Non-profit housing societies provide a critical\\nrole in developing and managing affordable housing options due to their ability to\\npartner with BC Housing and access funding from senior levels of government.\\n\\nLocal\\ngovernments play an important role in promoting the efforts of non-profit housing\\nsocieties to deliver affordable housing projects.\\n\\nMunicipal areas are better suited to\\naffordable multi-unit housing developments due to the presence of sewer and water\\nsupply systems, and proximity to transit, employment, good and services.\\n\\nPage 17 of 53\\nqathet Regional District Review of Rural Housing Solutions Page 10 of 46 Page 13 of 49\\n4.Collaborate with BC Transit to improve rural transit service - Improvements in\\ntransit will support the options for accessory dwelling units, shared housing and new\\nconstruction of housing in areas currently underserviced by transit.\\n\\nIt is\\nrecommended that the qRD collaborate with BC Transit to improve rural transit\\nservice to improve the liveability for seniors, youth and the work force.\\n\\n5.Promote public information on available grants - It is recommended that the qRD\\nprovide information on the qRD website regarding Homeowner Grants for home\\nmodifications to allow aging in place and for building accessory dwelling units.\\n\\nThe\\nwebsite could also include information for other grant programs and contact\\ninformation for BC Housing and CMHC.\\n\\n6.Promote partnership with Happipad - Happipad is a Canadian federally incorporated\\nnon-profit that has created an App and provides a service to facilitate home sharing\\nthat is safe, affordable, and accessible to those who can benefit most.\\n\\nIt is\\nrecommended that the qRD promote a partnership between a Non-Profit Housing\\nProvider and Happipad to support house sharing by linking landlords and tenants.\\n\\nThis recognizes that there are people who may have a suite to rent but want help\\nvetting tenants, assistance with lease preparation and understanding of the\\nlegislation.\\n\\nThis also recognizes that housing may be available but is not being\\nadvertised in a public manner.\\n\\n7.Consider review of manufactured home park policies - Manufactured homes and\\nmobile home provide important affordable housing options for people in the\\nelectoral areas.\\n\\nIt is recommended that the qRD review current manufactured home\\npark policies and consider supporting the expansion of existing\\nmanufactured/mobile home parks where provincial septic and water servicing\\nstandards can be met.\\n\\n8.Develop a process to track rental housing - It is recommended that the Regional\\nDistrict set up a voluntary online registry to track rental housing units in the electoral\\nareas.\\n\\nWithout building permit authority or business licensing authority, the qRD has\\nno way to track rental housing units in the electoral areas.\\n\\nIn addition, it is\\nrecommended that the qRD work closely with BC Housing to track new construction\\nin the electoral areas.\\n\\n9.Collaborate with City of Powell River to consider establishment of a regional housing\\nreserve fund -
