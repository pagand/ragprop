something we don't always think about but it's passively occurring around us sometimes where you see a\\nbuilding and go yeah that's a that that's really neat how they've done that entrance way or

advisory design panel\\nalongside me is Isabelle Kim Community planner and staff liazon to the community Heritage advisory committee we\\nwould like to welcome everyone here tonight to the 2003 design excellence in community Heritage Awards\\nso before we proceed with the ADP design Excellence award ceremony I'd like to First provide a brief background on the\\npanel and announce this year's nominees so the ADP is a technical\\ncommittee made up of experts in the field of architecture landscape architecture public art inclusivity and\\naccessibility engineering development construction ction and Public\\nSafety these panel members are volunteers all Northshore residents and appointed by\\n[Applause] Council the primary role of the panel is to provide independent advice to counsel\\nand staff on development applications through the lens of their professional experience and to evaluate these\\nprojects against Urban Design objectives to ensure they align with the district plans and\\npolicies in 1992 the panel established the annual design excellence awards\\nprogram to recognize design Excellence all completed projects within a calendar\\nyear are eligible for an award whereby the panel evaluates the projects based on a rating\\nsystem to determine if any qualify for a design Excellence award or an award of\\nMerit at this point I would like to take a moment to give recognition to our panel members members for uh who sit on\\nthe panel of this year we have rapael Santa Anna who is our chair and\\nprofessional architect Alexis shakon who's the co-chair and accessibility\\nrepresentative we then have two additional professional Architects Stuart rothney and fares Shafi Josh\\nburnson and Emily Blair are the panels to Landscape Architects from the development industry we have John\\nGilmore and the visual arts representative is Brian Newton and then finally we have Kusha K India who is a\\nprofessional engineer and Sergeant Kevin bracewell from the RCMP we are very lucky to have many\\nlocal professionals on the NorthShore who volunteer their time so we want to say a big thank\\nyou so moving on to the nominees we have five this year all of which are unique\\nwell thought out and important additions to our community so on the screen you see the first three nominees with the\\nnames of developers Architects Landscapes and public Consultants respectively underneath each photo the\\nfirst three nominees are Sunny Hurst homes Ean Flo in linmore\\napartment and the last two are Premier or sorry parksite on Premier and\\neastwoods now although all the nominees made significant contributions to our community\\nafter much deliberation this year the ADP decided to recognize only three Award of\\nmerits while all five nominees were commendable projects none quite met the criteria of design Excellence set by the\\npanel I think we still need to celebrate the effort and quality of all of these projects but this really this result\\nreally reflects the panel's commitment to upholding high standards of design excellence in our\\ncommunity and with that it's my pleasure to now announce the first award of Merit for this\\nyear first up an award of Merit goes to Evan Flo by developers Woodbridge and\\nCity Mark along with Choi architecture and M2 landscape architecture for\\nencouraging Community interaction in open space this is the first phase of 150 unit Strat Town Home Project in the\\nLionsgate Village the panel specifically congratulates the design team on a\\nwell-designed aesthetically pleasing

the members of council here in person uh welcome have a seat at one of the spots there and uh\\nwhen you're comfortable Walter you have three minutes to address the council okay thank you for inviting me\\nyour honor and council members I been playing pickle ball for about 10\\nyears at this point and always been involved in developing systems and things started pickle ball Northshore I\\nstarted pickleball BC um right now I'm working with the advocacy committee with the NorthShore\\npickleball group I've heard from several places that if we bring something to the\\ntable we'll get some recognition and that's what we plan to do in short order we've got a group\\nworking on at the present time and I hope to Shepherd them into a decent\\npresentation of what we'd like to see in terms of a significant pickle ball Hub\\non the North Shore thank you for your time thank you very much for your comments Walter NE the next speaker I\\nhave is Esa meld followed by Al\\nFloyd Welcome when you're comfortable you have three minutes to address the council thank you very much I'm Esa par\\nM I'm the current president of the NorthShore pickleball club I'm here today on behalf of thousands of existing\\nand emerging pickleball players in North Vancouver in support of councelor Pope's\\nmotion to plan for more pickleball courts as this motion motion suggests\\npickle ball demand is growing exponentially at this rate our thousand paying members of the NorthShore pickle\\nball Club are projected to become 5,000 in just six years and we're growing\\nyounger too pickleball courts are really a unique multi-generational facility\\nthat you can build for huge social benefit and relatively little money and\\nfirst I want to thank Council and the park staff uh for being leaders on the NorthShore with regards to pickle ball\\nsince 2019 you've built 12 beautiful outdoor courts but very wisely your Park staff\\nare continuing that planning process for for more courts a preliminary report on\\nSports courts was presented last week at the parts committee meeting and happily two locations for future courts have\\nbeen identified this motion however points to some other opportunities and and issues\\nfor consideration excuse me firstly unlike tennis people like to play short games\\nand swap partners and that's why larger groups of Courts like the four at little Kates and the six at Myrtle Fraser Park\\nattract a lot of people and this motion suggests that for the cost of paint you\\ncould probably increase the capacity at little Kates by 50% building additional courts eight\\ncourts from scratch requires a footprint of only two to three tennis courts and my people say it might cost $500,000\\ngive or take but eventually a 12 Court surface would fulfill everybody's\\ndreams secondly unlike tennis you can't just sprinkle courts into neighborhoods and which is why finding a site for a\\nlarger Congregation of Courts is preferred and I will say that since pickleball BC uh contracted sound\\nSpecialists this last year and released this planning and operation guide you can have full confidence that all future\\ncourts will be very wisely uh located interesting fact we have 14 pickle ball\\ncourts on in North Vancouver and 43 tennis courts I need to wrap up but I\\nwant to let you know that when there are lineups for courts Club volunteers facilitate fair and Equitable access\\nwith the permit time you generously provide us and happily Club volunteers also host a few times a week which helps\\nserve to distribute some of the demand to other times club play is where singles are welcome forgive me if I'm\\nimpatient but I'm old and I won't win any foot races those kids who are coming to get my courts so please pursue more\\ncourts that's all thank thank you very much for your presentation\\nright I will just say that we want to make sure that there isn't Applause and cheering or booing or any of that stuff\\nwe want to make sure people can bring forward uh um their views here without intimidation uh but I do understand\\nthere's a lot of passionate advocates in the sport here uh the next speaker I have is El Floyd followed by Angela\\nJackson\\nmembers of council welcome when you're comfortable you have three minutes to address the hearing yep thank you for\\nthe opportunity my name is Al Floyd uh my uh wife and I have lived at 4567\\nRayburn Street for 56 years I'm here to speak about the uh deep Co parking item\\non your agenda later um I attended your workshop in March and got the\\nopportunity thank thank you for uh to make a presentation however uh I was disappointed to see in\\nthe report in front of you today there's no change relative to 4,500 block of\\nringor Street uh all of the parking according to the\\nreport in the Cove in the core area except for this block of Rayburn Street\\nuh will have some form of mostly RPO uh and figures two on page 97 of\\nyour package today has a good diagram that shows there's little old rorn Street all weight with no uh\\nparticipation in any changes whatsoever uh when I spoke to the staff about this\\nwhen the original report came out they said the reason that uh Rayburn in this\\nblock was excluded was because there's not many houses on the street there's deep gold park on the North side and the\\nhouse on the South Side uh that is true probably there are 12 houses in this\\nblock but uh we have Parkside Lane which is a small street that fees into Rayburn\\nStreet about three4 of the way down it's a lane very narrow there are 27 houses\\non that street uh and they quite frequently uh use Rayburn Street in the\\n4500 block for their excess over for parking Trad people uh so it's uh not\\nquite fair to say that only the 12 houses on uh rbor Street in that block\\nuse the parking now because all of the other streets every street in the core area of\\nDeep Cove uh right over practic Strath Kota does have RPO\\nrecommended and and in that case and the way the signage is and the traffic flow in the cove all of the traffic or a\\nlarge part of it is directed to the 4500 block of RoR Street and the ironic part\\nof this is to make matters worse in the summertime when uh Cove Cliff school\\nparking lots are uh used for overflow parking the entrance to one of those\\nparking spot uh spaces is about a quarter of the way down RoR Street and\\nthere's a big sign that says parking this way uh down rurn street now they're\\nreferring to the Overflow but of course when the Overflow is normally fil filled\\nby 9 10 o'clock in the morning they decide we might as well carry on down Rayburn Street and maybe we'll find The\\nParking Spot well they don't because it is uh typically don't because it's full\\nalso by 9:00 uh and the strange thing about it is when they're going down river and\\nthey're going east and all the parking spaces are on the North side facing west so if they do find a parking spot they\\nmake a U-turn or turn around in somebody's driveway we're overtime Mr Floyd if you could draw to a close\\nplease okay uh and the one I want to mention that u in the staff in their\\nreport originally that was considered at the workshop one of their criteria was visitors will be encouraged to reduce\\ncircuitous movements by using parking restrictions thank you very much for your your comments Mr Floyd uh\\nunfortunately we do have to stick to a schedule and and but thank you very much for your\\ncomments this evening thank you okay the next speaker I have is Angela Jackson\\nfollowed by Emory uh ngi Angela Jackson may be joining us\\nvirtually uh Angela can you hear me yeah I can hear you can you hear me I can\\nclearly welcome you have three minutes to address the council meeting perfect thank you well good evening mayor and Council um as mentioned my name is\\nAngela Jackson and my husband and I have been residents of burns Avenue in Deep Cove for 30 years we find ourselves\\nright now at the center of the new parking regulations proposed by staff to council tonight our CER saac is one of\\nthe few residential streets with zero parking restrictions at present this Arrangement has worked pretty good for\\nus and Us and other residents on our street throughout our time here um and while our ceset can become very busy\\nduring the summer months and there is an increasing number of vehicles calls from adjacent streets permanently parking\\nhere we have managed to cope as a collective group of neighbors\\nour cesac applied for Resident parking only status about a year ago while we\\nwere granted RPO initially we subsequently withdrew our request this\\ndecision arose because the regulations would have replaced us in a significantly worse situation than our\\ncurrent one it became evident to us that surrounding streets such as Banbury\\ncalonia and Panorama which were also granted RPO status received multiple\\nparking permits per household along with additional visitor parking permits in\\nsome cases consequently our cesac was surprised to discover that we would only\\nbe granted one perking pal per sorry one parking permit per household requiring\\nthat vehicle to be registered and Link to that specific residential\\naddress and on top of that no visitor parking permits at all this realization\\nprompted our withdrawal from the process my question to District staff\\nand Council today is when these new regulations are approved will every\\nresidential home within one zone be treated equally or will will there will there be\\na situation of zoning within zoning due to certain grandfathering\\nscenarios I am sure that the current holders of RPO permits would object if\\nthey were to lose their current multiple parking permit allocations furthermore residents yet to\\nbe zoned will be very disappointed if they are not treated fairly and do not receive equal\\nconsideration thank you very much for allowing me the time to address this issue with you thank you for your comments Angela\\nJackson the next speaker I have is emry n followed by Sonia\\nsuzak Em's joining us here in person welcome when you're comfortable you have three minutes to address the council\\nthank you first I want to thank the council for this opportunity to address our concerns my family and I live at\\nRock Cliff Road for the last 14 years goes without saying we love the area and cannot see ourselves anywhere\\nelse would like to express my obser ations regarding what we currently refer to as the zoo having to do with parking\\nand traffic concerns on rockcliff road mostly in the warm weather months increase during the weekends from\\nnumerous conversations with my neighbors we all share the feeling the district has graciously set aside permitted\\nresident only parking for the residents of the street currently in effect from the period of March 01 to September 30th\\nmost of the resident permit spots are located in front of their home homes in our case across the road from our home\\nat the top of rockliff we have five spots allocated for between three and four homes while this dat period was adequate\\nwhen we first moved into the area it is no longer so many weekends outside of that calendar period now have\\nsignificant visitors which on occasion means again we are left without any parking much more disturbing is the\\naggressive interaction with visitors who surely after spending considerable time\\ntrying to locate parking are often extremely agitated and frustrated and\\ndecide to utilize permitted spots ourselves and our neighbors have routinely notified visitors they cannot\\nlegally park there few are thankful and move however 30% of the time the\\nresponse is too bad that is where they will be staying and have no issue in paying whatever the parking fine is\\nwhich currently is $45 paid within seven days when informed we will be contact\\nacting parking control to try to have them towed an idle threat since bylaw refuses to tow responses vary however\\nbeing verbally attacked and or threatened laughed at and on one memorable interaction my vehicle was\\nkeyed down the entire side after an hour some do however leave at that point\\nmy rough estimation is that Peak periods between 100 vehicles per hour drive by repeatedly looking for parking and a few\\nend up taking any available spots in previous years it was common during the day to have four or five different\\ncycles of vehicles parking illegally in each stall bylaws generally would make one or two visits per day usually\\nbetween 10:00 a.m. and 3 p.m. meaning both vehicles do not even get a ticket I\\nmust add we seem to be having more frequent visits from BW this year thank you for that Tuesday nights have also\\nbecome challenging the kayak Center holds races in the summer that start at 7 p.m. people though there are no\\nenforcement of parking regulations through the time and make use of any spots available including resident\\nareas in almost every other jurisdiction people Park in residential only areas\\nthey're potentially towed we respectfully request the council provide direction to engineering and bylaws to\\nstart enforcing parking regulations by Towing illegally parked Vehicles seems to be the only measure to have people\\nrespect RPO spots side not I cannot understand why temporary signage leading\\nto Deep Cove keep displaying the message Deep Cove parking is full however overflow parking\\navailable this gives drivers false hope and it's simply not accurate but 10 a.m on warm weekends all parking is full I\\nmean why why do we keep having that chair anyways thank you very much for the time and have a great day thank you\\nvery much next speaker I have is Sonia susac followed by Shelley\\nwheel joining us virtually hi there can you hear me uh yes I can\\nwelcome you have uh three minutes to address the council okay thank you very much for your time I'm Sonia\\nrepresenting the residents Cliffwood Lane and Cliffwood Lo uh Road I too am\\num uh to the agenda item 8.6 regarding the parking in Deep Cove um our streets\\nhave some concerns with the future plans of what's being slated for the parking\\non our streets uh for reasons that I discussed at the last meeting but in a\\nnutshell we're we're concerned about the continued circling of par cars the safety of the kids the property wear and\\ntear and obviously availability for the homeowners uh when the public come in\\nand take up all our spots um and now uh I'll turn specifically to Cliffwood Lane\\nI see on the map that they've slotted us for 80% timed and 20% that's what it\\nlooks like anyways 80% for Time parking 20% RPO well I don't know how that's\\ngoing to service our our neighborhood because there's nine homes that utilize Cliffwood Lane and already there's maybe\\n12 spots so if 0 of that is timed and we\\nthere's an event in the cove and we go out we come home and we cannot find a spot so I'm not sure if that can be\\namended to 100% RPO or possibly reverse sit and have 80% RPO and a couple spots\\nvisitors because we're already struggling and we have nothing so I'm not sure how that's going to work um and\\nI also uh wanted to just clarify uh my understanding is that each home will be given two decal assigned to their home\\nso I hope that still will be in play um given this situation but again I I can't\\nstress enough that we would prefer Cliffwood Lane and Cliffwood Road being 100% RPO just due to safety and the\\ncircling and the congestion and yeah it it it's becoming a headache for us here\\nyeah and and Horseshoe Bay has gone completely uh paid parking or no parking\\nand the businesses function and they seem to make it work so I'm not sure why we can't do the\\nsame for our our neighborhoods here thank you I think that's it okay\\nthank you thank you very much for your comments uh Sonia susak uh the next speaker I have is Shelley wheel followed\\nby Candace Quinn joining us in person welcome when you're comfortable you have three\\nminutes to address the council thank you may and Council for giving me time I'm here to talk about the motion regarding\\npickle ball courts um aside from being a pickle ball Enthusiast I'm also a district taxpayer\\nand and so far and so am concerned about the cost of installing the courts but also the lack of land\\navailable on Saturday at the beginning of April we were playing at Tempe and we had 16 players being playing pickle ball\\nin One tennis ball court eight were standing on the on the empty tennis court actually waiting to play so having\\na large group of friends who play the game uh one night we after a couple bottles of wine we thought well maybe we\\nshould find out if there's available space to play pickle ball or maybe it's just our imagination that there's courts\\nthat are free so we started what was called a court Crusade and the objective was to find out if in Lind Valley\\nspecifically there was more room to have some pickleball courts uh so we went and\\nwe did it very I'm not going to say this is the way you should study usage but what we did is we decided we were going\\nto check who was playing on the courts at what time so we had randomly over about a 19-day period we went and\\nchecked at different times of the day we checked tempy or I know isn't even ours\\num but Karen magn and the Caren Magnus lacrosse box the Westover who who have a\\nbeautiful practice wall as well and a parking lot uh The Institute pickle\\nbille courts and Underwood there's also the two located at princess Park and bremar which they were too far to drop\\nyou so we didn't go there anyway so we checked those out um and over this time\\nwe came we found that of there are nine tennis courts and essentially One tennis\\ncourt including Tempe that we can use to play pickle ball of the people we saw\\nplaying there was 11 over that period of time there was 11 people playing tennis\\nthere was 66 people playing pickle ball so on One tennis court so for we're\\nadvocating for ly Valley to actually have more Court um we think this is an\\nunderutilization of District assets do I understand that tennis doesn't want to\\nlose space I'm sure they don't because it's a great sport as well um but with\\nthis kind of usage I'm not sure there's not Ral rationalization to if not hand it over to share it um totally\\nunderstand why more fome tracking wouldn't be necessary than what we did\\num the noise issue I understand is always out there uh Karen Magnus though we live right by there that lacrosse box\\nis perfectly located to affect very few people and even the ones behind the church maybe you can't play Sunday\\nmorning but there's some room there I believe um so we are hoping to see that\\nthose areas uh looked into um Lind Valley is densifying uh quite a bit uh\\nwe're at a highway kind of choke point uh in the area and we are a big tourist attraction area so what we have to do as\\nLind Valley residents is to get out of our cars and be able to walk to our courts and this is why I'm hoping that\\nwe can find some space in our in in the tennis courts that are available in L Valley to add some pickle ball space\\novertime if you could draw close okay I'm done thank you so much for your comments [Music]\\nsh all right the next speaker I have is Candace Quinn followed by Phil\\ngrai thank you mayor and Council for your time um I've joined this evening\\njust to for agenda item um regarding the Deep Co parking review um I can\\ncompletely acknowledge that a lot of time has been put into this project what I really appreciate I'm I'm a resident\\nof Deep Cove um on cliffmont road and and I'm fine with what I've seen\\nproposed in terms of the restrictions personally um in terms of zoning and restrictions however the part of the\\ndocument that I'm a bit concerned about on page 99 states that Resident parking permits um will be available for\\npurchase um I know a few of the other residents have already stated that um\\nhouseholds will potentially get free permits which was what I was actually going to propose um so ideally I would\\nlike clarification on whether or not households will be getting um a certain\\namount of permits per year and also visitor um parking passes um because\\nobviously we living in this area the the I think the proposed parking plan is to\\nhelp improve quality of life for residents in the area during the busy season um and having to actually pay for\\nparking permits for the privilege to park on our own roads uh um obviously would take away from that goal um so\\nyeah so if there is if it is going to be um a situation where we're having to buy\\nthe permits to park on our own Road I'd like to propose that we do get an allotted amount of uh parking permits um\\nthroughout the year for her household and in addition to have visitor passes\\nas well and that's everything so thank you for your time okay thank you very much\\nfor your comments Candace Quinn and the last speaker in public input tonight is Phil\\ngrai joining us here in person uh welcome when you're comfortable you have three minutes to address the council\\nmeeting hello is that Gavin Joyce they see in the background no still still\\nhanging in there that boy gav's in my neighborhood uh my name is\\nuh Phil grassy resident of um 2465 Berkeley since\\n1989 I've been active in sports most of my life if not all my life been involved\\nto high levels of teams with hockey lacrosse baseball and pickle ball for over a\\nyear what should be highlighted with pickle ball when mixed with other sports is the huge social aspect of the sport I\\nmean there is a a hockey there is definitely a a room and we have a lot of\\nfun and everything else but this is huge going into going to a pickle ball court the way we play it here with a community\\nyou're not sitting in a room with 15 people you're you're in a room with it's I we've had 30 40 people and you get to\\nknow everybody and and uh you get to um you play against each other you play\\nagainst uh with people and you share the the L it's it's it's a beautiful sport the\\npoint I want to talk to about is the younger generation that are now growing the sport this group are commonly online\\ncommun communicating and dating um they do not participate face\\nToof face and I'm looking at this this sport is a perfect opportunity for a\\ngeneration that's it's that seems to be as is showing up\\nand the fact that they can come and um you rotate with participants it allows\\nfor easy communication between new and regular players the face-to-face contact\\nthat is missing from this generation is made very easy by the informalities of\\nthis game the only barrier now is the is more\\ninvolvement I'm sorry the only barrier now to more involvement from a very\\ncurious group of younger generation or more courts thank you thank you very much uh\\nPhil grassy and uh I was um I I actually do have one other person who signed up to speak before the meeting and so I do\\nhave one more speaker here this is uh John Grant joining us here in\\nperson welcome and when you're comfortable you have three minutes to address the\\ncouncil had you set it up ahead of time on the okay you can try it so you plug just\\nbelow the lip of the desk on your side you'll see a USB slot and you should be able to fire it in\\nthere and uh if it's an Apple product I can't help\\nyou that much but um uh the PC products tend to work fairly well for the slid\\nshows and such\\nno that's\\nokay seems like it's come it looked like it was coming up but do they still have we have to shrink\\nthe old slide presentation or there you go I do apologize this is\\num this's a bit on left field in terms of parking and pickle ball and I appreciate I'm off\\nagenda it's a bit of a heavy topic too and I don't take it lightly but I'm here to talk about the uh proposed provincial\\nlegislation on resoning uh in particular there we go in particular you know it shows that 42% of\\nthe people in the district will be exempt from the possible rezoning um selfishly I you know I like I live in\\nthe forest interface Zone I would like to be included in the resoning uh\\nbecause I'd like to use it to help my family Thrive here which is to say you know how common is the question we hear\\nin our community what are the children going to do for housing well this this uh proposed legislation May provide that\\nfor us uh but I do see a greater opportunity for us as a community and that's that's what brought me here and I\\nrecognize we're talking about fire here and I don't take I do not take that lightly believe me actually in fact two\\nof my family members died in a fire when I was quite young and uh yeah so I do\\nnot take that lightly so believe me when I tell you I'm just saying hey let's change the fire Zone um what I like to\\npoint out to you is that uh so we've been Exempted and I understand the purpose and I've read up on the purpose of the fire zone uh but I'd like to\\npoint out to you that houses are part of the problem here in fire zones like if we look at Lon if we look at Paradise in\\nCalifornia we look at Colona or soyers etc etc but if you look at this house in uh La haa Hawaii the owner built it with\\na metal roof concrete walls and and fire resistant landscaping and they didn't do it on purpose but it just turn it turned\\nout that it saved the house uh and and I think that as a result of all these tragedies uh fire resistant\\nhousing has become much more of a reality so what I came here today to say to all of you was the idea that we put\\non a blanket on the on the um fire interface Zone and say that if you're going to build there you have to build\\nwith uh maximum fire resistant um thinking in mind you know take take my\\nhouse for example it's a vinyl clad house it has a shingle roof it's surrounded by Cedar hedges would it not\\nbe better that we took the opportunity in this resoning to change it into something that was heavily fortified in\\nterms of fire resistance right the fire the fire you know in Heavens that we don't have that but should this happen\\nwe can have houses as a defense in the fire zone as opposed to being something that will help it jump so I'm just I'm\\nproposing this idea to us that we have maximum fire um interface dens or sorry\\num mitigation and I just like to propose this to you now because I know the timeline is June 30th and I just want to\\nbe part of a process that's like Fair Equitable and um yeah inclusive thank\\nyou uh thank you very much the item is not on tonight's agenda so I I'm not\\ngoing to go into a great deal detail on it um but I will just say just to clarify your first comment was that it\\nwas proposed legislation from The Province to be clear they already gave Royal Ascent to the part that uh for 44\\nthat we would we U um we have to comply with so the provincial side has already\\nbeen done we have to bring our zoning in compliance to match uh the provincial what I would imagine and Council hasn't\\nhad a a full discussion about this but at this point we are putting in the exemptions for DPA Wildfire slope uh\\nflood um as hazards under 44 um but I imagine that uh we will have to address\\nuh coming up with I ways to meet the test if somebody can make a house out of\\nnon-combustible material like we we release the DPA if somebody produces a\\nhouse with non-combustible materials um under our normal process uh likewise if\\nwe can defense against floods sometimes we'll release the DPA on that if it's on a slope and we have an Geotech and\\nengineer address the slope hazards and so in the past our DPA and Hazard uh rules were done to sort of uh to help us\\npress for those improvements in the housing before they get approved now um\\nwe have to decide how we're going to use the exemptions um going forward so uh out of the gate the legislation will be\\nbased on on the current regulation but I do anticipate that we will have to have discussion in the medium term about how\\nto release places that can mitigate the risk in their in their space I think it's unreasonable not to have some\\ndiscussion about that in there so thank you very much for raising the matter for tonight's thank you for the response\\nthank you everybody\\nokay all right Council uh returning back to the order of the agenda um I do think\\nReports from council or staff\\nthat it's a good idea to prepare a consent agenda so that we can focus our time on the issues where um where uh\\nCouncil wants to have uh Fuller discussions um I I had an initial um consent agenda proposed by Council back\\nwhich was to consent items 8.1 8.2 and\\n8.5 so this is uh the development variants permit uh co- house for 1564\\nLind Valley Road bylaw 8684 provincial electric Kick Scooter pilot Project\\nExtension and uh 8.5 grant funding application for Kates Park wayt in\\nShoreline restoration since that time I did have a member of council wish to pull 85\\nbut not hearing that okay so we'll put it forward for Council for those three\\nitems 81 82 and 85 any of council if they wish can withdraw the items for consent for Fuller discussion as part of\\nthe regular agenda hearing none okay so it's uh moved by councelor back you you\\nraised it so I'll take it as moved by councelor back second by councelor Pope prepared to call the question all in favor contrary minded motion carries so\\nif you came here to hear about 8.1 8.2 or 8.5 those items have just passed and\\nwe'll focus the remainder of the time on the other uh items so the next item up\\n8.3 Bylaw 8689: 2024 Tax Rates Bylaw\\nfor discussion is is item 8.3 this is the tax rates bylaw 8689\\n2024 and uh's staff get\\nprepared so Mr danelo and uh Mr eorio are online uh to answer questions Mr\\ndanock do you have any opening comments on the matter thank you worship yes I do at the April 15th property tax\\ndistribution Workshop after considering the district's tax rates are gener competitive within the region and\\nconsidering the issues within each of the property classes as well as the additional support being provided by by\\nThe Province to business this year Council directed staff to prepare the 2024 tax rates bylaw based on even\\ndistribution of the tax levy among the property classes staff will also be\\npreparing a report back on the property tax strategy later this\\nfall and St for available that answer any other questions Council may\\nhave okay thank you very much I'll be moving the recommendation is there a second or on the\\nmatter seconded by Council mury uh just my own comments we've obviously had lots of public discussions leading up to this\\num uh process um obviously we're not eager to be passing along a 7% uh cost\\nto our community but that does reflect the increased costs that we've seen our construction costs have been coming back\\nway higher than that so that is a averaged out across our op operations um\\nand there's no way that we could um come down to a lower amount without\\nsignificantly uh reducing changing our operations in the organization um I I\\nwill do everything I can to make sure that this is a one-time thing and that we return to the pattern that we had of\\nof low tax increases where we're I think for about a 14-year period uh we had we\\nwere below 3% uh at or below 3% uh and then last year we had a slightly Higher\\nOne and then this one at seven um so you have my commitment to do everything we can to to keep that down going forward\\nbut there's no question that it reflects a higher cost of doing business as a municipality in our community um and if\\nuh if you saw some of the prices of the contracts are coming back you'd be uh very shocked um at what the cost of of\\ngetting work done on the NorthShore has moved to um but uh at this time so I\\nwill be supporting the rec recomendation after the whole process that we've been through uh which is that it is 7%\\ndistributed across all classes evenly um I guess I should make a comment on that\\nat the workshop we did consider um uh potentially looking at relief for um\\nLight Industry specifically um and we did talk about earlier about relief for um for business\\nCommunity um there are other ways that we can um offer um relief and benefit to\\nto those kinds of organizations to our other policies uh but at this time because of their ability to write off a\\nlot of the costs for their Taxation and also because uh we're trying to make sure that we're not overburdening the\\nResidential Properties as well uh I think it's prudent for us to keep it equal across all classes uh this time uh\\nwe have in the past done two shifts I believe to uh from commercial to residential uh but um uh we I don't see\\nthat being a significant benefit even to the commercial classes a lot of people want to see us give relief to the small\\nbusinesses in our community and there's no question that um a lot of businesses are stressed but when you use this tool\\nas the way to do it you're overwhelmingly giving the benefit to uh large organizations the the McDonald's\\nand Starbucks and all of the other large organizations before you're actually giving it to the mom and pop uh stores\\nthat we we definitely want toh keep uh because they keep our community interesting um and so we'll have to look\\nfor other ways to to assist whether it's better use of the curb space uh to make sure they can turn over parking for\\ncustomer purposes or other mechanisms available to us but uh transferring off the class into residential is uh a\\nfairly blunt tool and doesn't help us uh Focus the benefit where the benefits needed uh plus the issue of the\\nrestaurant um losses is something that we're seeing across the entire provin BC\\nuh so it is a larger economic problem that we're we're facing but um uh we do we have been putting resources into uh\\nneonilla loba's work to look at the environment uh for uh businesses in our\\ncommunity to make sure that they're properly supported by the municipality whether that is with uh outdoor customer\\nservice areas or other permitting processes that they need to go through and making sure that those are done in an efficient manner um so we're we're\\ngoing to try and help those businesses in other ways that are a little more um tailored um but um so at this point I'm\\ngoing to be supporting the recommendation which is uh that it be shared across all classes evenly at\\n7% uh Council M additional comments uh thank you mayor little I\\nvoted against the 7% increase um during this year's budget um I felt that it was\\ntoo much uh considering uh the impact to the utility um the community is aware of\\nthe um the uh uh increase to the sew treatment plant on the North Shore um\\nnotwithstanding uh future projects within Metro um those projects were at once one time tens of millions or\\nhundreds of millions of dollars we're now talking billions and billions of\\ndollars we have a population of two and a half million people in this region growing by an extra million in in the\\nfuture um probably growing beyond that and uh this is what growth costs and uh\\ndevelopment has not pay been paying for growth Metro Vancouver has made that statement um they've been pushing hard\\nhard on the fact that the development Community has not been paying for the growth that we've been receiving we\\nalready see the impact of growth we need more pickle ball courts uh we don't have enough parking in Deep Cove um we don't\\nhave enough Trails for all the people that are living in Towers in other parts of the region that don't have backyards\\nlike we do um that all costs money um this budget um part of it is to continue\\nthem to maintain the implementation of our ocp which is based on growth\\nand uh I I think that we need to pull back I think that we need to start living within our means when you get\\nyour utility bill this year um you'll you'll have a good discussion with yourself about what living within your\\nmeans is all about uh it's going to be something that you haven't seen before in fact your\\nutility bill in the future will surpass your taxes your your property taxes it\\nwill surpass your taxes for land and land is some of the most expensive in\\nthe province if not this country so um I think that Council really needs to have\\na very good heart-to-heart about how we're going to move forward we're very um spoiled we're very fortunate on the\\nNorthShore we have a lot um all of the um additions the amenities that you see\\nwith the new town centers lower Lyn ly Valley lower capalino all those new plazas and parks and all of the trails\\nand the facilities and the spines to ride your bikes on all of those me much of that has been given by the\\ndevelopment Community as part of density um they all become depreciating assets on our books and we are responsible to\\nreplace them in the future so um just like your own home um you don't buy new\\nfurniture when you have a roof a leak in your roof uh you wait and fix the roof first uh we have to do a better job and\\nthrough our asset management we're going to start working at um making sure that our assets are looked after there's been\\na glut in our parks department over the years parks are working hard to um catch up to that blut that um we've deferred\\nover the years um but we have to look after the the bones of our municipality\\nfirst and um all the extras I think we have to really have a a heart-to-heart\\ndiscussion about whether or not we're going forward and how much we can all afford we have an aging population in\\nthe district um we're we're land rich and many of us are cash poor and um I\\nthink we have to really understand what's coming and part of that is the growth within the region\\nTransportation utilities um and the things that keep\\nthe hold on hold on people can defer their taxes but you\\ncannot defer your utilities you must pay them yeah okay we're not going to have a\\ndiscussion here Council M if you can complete your comments that'd be appreciated thank you so you can defer your taxes thank you very much Madam for\\num um bringing that up you can defer your property taxes but you cannot defer your utilities currently the provincial\\nlegislation does not mean does not allow you to do that and uh with those utility bills that will surpass your property\\ntaxes um it will be challenging for many many maybe not some but for many it will\\nbe very challenging so um this is about spreading the taxes across classes it's\\nnot necessarily about approving the increase that's already been done this is about how we spread it fairly over\\nthe different taxes industrial Light industrial commercial residential as an example\\nthank you very much counselor councelor Hansen yeah thank you very much um I'm\\ngoing to just immediately jump in on the issue of the deferral just for clarification so everyone does\\nunderstand you cannot defer your utilities and one thing that everyone at\\nthis table knows and many in the community now know is that the cost of utilities are going to be rising very\\nsignificantly uh this was uh brought uh out recently by councelor Pope uh with\\nrespect to the cost of the NorthShore ww waterer treatment uh plant and other uh\\nutilities that's being well broadcast so we can expect utilities to arise\\nabruptly and we're not going to be able to defer those uh dealing just more\\nbroadly with the issue of deferring taxes uh just because you're able to put your taxes uh put them on a debt doesn't\\nmean that everyone in the community wishes to face ever larger growth growing taxes and just treat them as a\\nform of debt so I like councel are very sensitive uh to the issue of tax rates\\nand we're not going to be wishing that issue Away by saying well you can defer it because you're going to have to pay\\nit eventually with compound interest uh not withstanding that I did vote in\\nfavor of the 7% increase I view it to be a correct balance against the very challenging competing needs of Taxation\\non the one hand and the needs of our community and making sure that our fiscal house is in order going forward\\nwith respect to what we pay now what we pay in the future if uh we Short change\\nthat increase in my view too much we're just putting it off to other people down the road who are going to have to pay\\noff the debts and so forth that are incurred uh for some of the uh infrastructure projects um I also\\nsupport even distribution in this case as against the uh classes uh\\nthis was being debated in the workshop and I won't uh go over it again except to say that I do think in this\\ncircumstance even distribution is appropriate um I look forward to the\\nreview in the fall of uh the taxation on the major industrial classes I\\nunderstand there's going to be a broader review uh with respect to uh how the classes can contribute and uh how that\\nshould be going forward I also look forward to the discussion with respect to how the Ral housing legislation which\\nhas the potential to increase residential property assessments is going to affect our the need to ensure\\nfairness and balance in our taxation I'm going to use uh the little bit of time I have left to focus on an issue that I'm\\nuh particularly perturbed by which is the ports property uh tax act when I was\\nfirst elected in 2014 I was shocked to learn uh that the large some of the\\nlarge Industries and biggest potential polluters in our uh Community uh were\\ngiven a special deal by the provincial government whereby their taxes were capped and the rate of increase on those\\ntaxes have been capped and that was in 2014 uh we're now um 10 nine 10 years\\npast that this issue continues to be flagged with the provincial government and nothing is being done about it the\\neffect of this is that every year uh residential class and light non-capped\\nheavy industry Light Industry business class you're all going to pay 7% more\\nthere's only one set of taxpayers in the community that aren't going to pay more and that's the Capp heavy Industries the\\nlargest uh industrial concerns down at the waterfront they will not pay their\\n7% because of that you guys are going to have to pay extra to make it make up what they're not paying it's time I say\\nfor the vental government to address this inequity of the ports Property Tax Act which frankly has gone on long\\nenough thank you very much thank you for your comments counselor councelor back thank you Mar little um my concern\\nyou know I supported the 7% property tax increase this year um I can certainly appreciate that that's a large increase\\nand uh I want to see it Bel lower next year and into the future um but I think\\nwhen we look across the region when we look at what some of these projects are costing um you know it's just a reality\\nof of the environment that we're in right now um I can appreciate the comments around living within our means\\num but the reality is you know we're talking about um things like uh turf fields like pickle ball courts\\npotentially um like active Transportation routes and things that our community really expects uh these\\nare priorities that that were made um by this Council so I I don't want to see uh\\nlower taxes to you know at the expense of some of these really important Community amenities that I think our\\ncommunity really expects and and wants to see um you know upgrades to some of our parks and and various facilities\\nwithin those Parks I think are are really important um right now um I'm often concerned about small business as\\nwell and and the impact that these sorts of tax increases have um although I do\\nsupport the even distribution right now because I do think um we want to try and\\nyou know respect what the the level of increase that residents are seeing um\\nbut hopefully we can assist particularly small business through um different ways uh I know we have our Economic\\nDevelopment strategy that will be presented to council very soon um so I'm hoping that there are going to be some actions in there for instance where we\\ncan where we can assist U some of the small businesses in our community um but\\nI think at this time the even distribution makes sense although you know I do hope that we we won't see this\\nlevel of tax increase moving forward and with regards to the wastewater treatment plant I'm hopeful that there is going to\\nbe some appetite from around the region to to share that cost a little differently um and not put the burden\\nall on Northshore residents which I don't think is fair uh these costs didn't escalate they were they were not\\nanything that um the residents here on the NorthShore did uh so I I'm hopeful that they we're going to see some\\nmovement there but uh I will support the recommendation thank you councelor back\\ncouncelor ma thank you uh at the recent tax\\nWorkshop that uh members have referred to I recall that we all recognize that\\nthere are competing interests and there are many things that we want to do to keep the district a great place to\\nlive however I've also heard that we need to watch our expenses and the term keeps coming up we need to live within\\nour means we really don't want to be facing another 7% tax increase next year\\nat the same time we need to have policies that support local Industries and small businesses we struggle to find that\\nbalance at this point all things consider I I support an even distribution of the of the tax increase\\nthank you very much see no further speakers on the matter prepared to call the question\\nall those in favor contrary minded motion carries thank you very much\\n8.4 Housing Supply Act - Housing Target Progress Reporting for the - District of North Vancouver, October 1, 2023 – March 31, 2024\\nokay the next item is item 8.4 this is the housing Supply act housing Target progress reporting for the district\\nNorth Vancouver October 1st 2023 to March 31st 2024 Mr Milburn I'll look to\\nyou uh thank you very much your worship members of council members of the public uh Miss Tina ATA manager or pardon me uh\\ndirector of planning is going to be uh uh coming forward and giving a brief\\npresentation just wanted to note that this is the result of the housing Supply Act and the housing Target order the\\ndistrict received um in late September early October of last year a couple key\\nmessages uh it's notable that the amount of occupancies that will be shown is in\\nexcess of what the provincial government indicated as a minimum requirement um I do note however that development\\nactivity fluctuates predominantly from the timelines of developers and how quickly they construct um so this can\\nfluctuate year to year also notably the numbers of applications that we have\\nnumbers of units under application we have in process uh demonstrates that if those units uh achieve the policies of\\nthe district and are approved and ultimately built that the district could see the amount of units anticipated by\\nThe Province as are need in the district so those are some of the key messages and I'd like to pass it off to miss\\nabon thank you welcome thank you very much good evening your worship members of council this item is the housing\\nTarget progress report our first one in the order given to us from the province like again it was last fall when the\\nprovince of BC issued a housing Target order for the district the order gives\\nus a minimum number of net new completed housing units to achieve within five\\nyears it also sets annual targets and gives us a schedule of reporting\\nessentially at six months and then at every year point so the first six-month\\nreporting period was from October 1st 2023 to March 31st 2024 so this short\\npresentation focuses on this time\\nperiod what I'd like to point out as well that in the council report the\\nattachment number one is actually the progress report which is proposed and required to be provided to the province\\nattachment to actually contains the order from the minister these few Graphics will show\\nthe progress that we have been making and I'll just point out that the words on the left are not going to change but\\nthe graphics on the right will change to help demonstrate where we've come to date again\\n2838 net new housing completed units is to be completed by September 30th\\n20128 and the one-year Target is 499 completed\\nunits and again just want to say completed housing units are those that have achieved occupancy they're are\\noccupied they've been occupied since September 30th or they're ready to be occupied so the grant the the total\\nnumber of units that have received ready for occupancy less those that have been\\ndemolished so that is why the net number comes into play so 499 units is our Target for year\\none if we were to look at halfway through the first year which is essentially where we are now that we\\ndivide 499 by two ly 250 housing units in that first six\\nmonths the district has achieved 388 net new completed housing units in this\\nfirst six month period so this puts us on track to to to meet or exceed the\\none-year Target of 499 just would like to spend a couple\\nminutes looking at the fiveyear Target now again 2,838 units shown on the right hand side\\nthe six-month Mark shown in dashed at the bottom if we were to look at six-month segments all the way through\\nagain this is for demonstration purposes and especially for this first six-month reporting period which is the only\\nsix-month reporting period this light green box shows the\\n388 units that we've uh seen achieve occupancy since September\\n30th and to give an indication of where we might be going and how we might meet the progress in five years we've\\nadded on this light green box which shows 2,614 multif family units that have been\\napproved for rezoning and are moving through the remaining approval processes being development permit construction of\\ncourse we the market will fluctuate and that there the amount of development will vary from year to year but this\\ndoes give us an indication that not only are we on track for the first six months that we may be well on track for the\\nentire five years of course we will need to see how how things unfold the recommendations before\\nCouncil today are to receive the staff report the staff report includes the progress report that's required to be\\nsubmitted to the province we are required to do that submit this to the province within 45 days we are also then\\nrequired to post this information on our website as soon as practical staff will continue to monitor\\nour housing progress and units that reach completion with the next update\\nanticipated or required shortly after September 30th\\n2024 thank you okay I'll be moving the recommendations both of them is there a\\nsecond on the matter second by councelor Hansen um my own comments on it um I\\nguess one thing I would look to staff for as a response is um when we built the Seymour local plan\\nas an example the old Seymour local plan we said that you could borrow from one segment to the other in order to sort of\\nbe able to smooth it out over time because you may have a situation where um units were being uh created um you\\nknow all at once and then you may have a period of time where nothing else comes forward you alluded to it at the beginning Mr Melbourne um do we have the\\nability to report to the province the averaging or do we have to um uh is it\\nis our compliance going to be based on that particular\\nsegment uh thank you very much your worship um in early consultation with\\nthe province uh they indicated that they understand that there are other Market forces and other reasons why approvals\\nmay occur at at not a consistent rate approximately 500 units a year um and\\nthat they would essentially if say we um didn't have as many occupancies as the\\nTarget in a particular year what the province would essentially do is is um come in and meet with staff and look at\\nwhat were the issues around the approvals was it directly related to a Market Force or was it something related\\nto an action of the district and um and really just try to further understand and learn about the changes and so I\\nthink that there is recognition from the provincial government um and and that you know ultimately we're all trying to\\nachieve the same goal which is to um address housing needs in the community um in this U particular Circumstance the\\nprovince has set a set a goal and they're looking to track that over time um which is their public objective and\\num however there is recognition that there is variability over time as well I was just going to say you know I think\\nthat the um uh from my conversations with members of the development Community uh there were a lot of them\\nhope hoping we'll say that the interest rates would have dropped in the last Go Round And instead the interest rates\\nheld and so I think under a tremendous amount of pressure they were really optimistic that that that round of\\ninterest rates was going to drop with hopefully another round later in the year um and so it will be interesting to\\nsee how many of them may delay their start at this time um now obviously\\nwe're going to be measuring completions but you may have a bit of a gap moving through the system if they're anticipating waiting for um preferable\\nborrowing conditions uh compared to what we have for construction Bridge financing right now um and so you may\\nhave a bit of a gap built in just simply because um they're anticipating risk um\\nin their in their project um so it's uh I I hope that we're able to provide a\\nsort of smooth completion that generally reflects things but uh some of those\\nthings are are outside of our hands they are they are tied to the economic conditions the risk profiles that the\\ndevelopment Community is comfortable with and um and I think probably for the\\nnext little bit there there may be some delays and starts as they uh wait for those preferable conditions um but uh\\nI'll be supportive of uh the um uh a receipt and referring the matter to uh\\nreferring the report to the provincial government in compliance with the housing Supply act uh councelor Hansen\\nyeah thank you very much your worship and thank you to staff for the uh corer ANF housing Target uh progress report\\nwhich was prepared which I read with great interest a lot of detail there uh the housing order calls for us to\\nproduce 2,838 homes in 5 years a very interesting how uh close that is to the\\n3,28 units that we' completed in the last five years um I remain at a loss to\\nknow why uh we were singled out uh in such a prominent way for this housing\\norder when what was mandated Upon Us apparently it was done with objective metrics I'd be fascinated to know those\\nobjective metrics uh when the order that was imposed upon us is actually to produce less housing than we have been\\nproducing um anyway that's the truth and that's where we're at we're well on track to live up to the order as is\\nstated uh one uh concern that I have and that I would note is that um as we have\\ngone along I've been a consistent advocate for rental housing uh below Market housing um uh support of Housing\\nand just using this snapshot of the 388 net new which is the last 6 months\\nthat's 290 Market strata uh only 98 Randall and of that only 90 purpose\\nbuilt rent seven secondary suets and Coach houses so I do hope going forward\\nand I know there's information in the uh housing Target progress report which\\nwould uh make us believe that going forward we are going to achieve a greater proportion of uh purpose built\\nrental U uh affordable housing and uh Supportive Housing but it it's something\\nI think we definitely need to keep an eye on because if all we do in the next five years is replicate what we did in\\nthe last five years uh we're not going to create any housing affordability we may create housing but it's not going to\\nbe housing affordability um with those comments again I I thank staff for all the work involved and uh look forward to\\nthese updates and look forward to working during the next five years towards rental affordable and Supportive\\nHousing thank you thank you councelor Hansen councelor mury I'm just wondering thank you m little I'm just wondering if\\nstaff could just explain appendix B the housing unit breakdown and what those numbers refer\\nto is that the total number of what we're talking about in regards to the uh\\nthe larger number that the province thought we weren't going to achieve\\nit's on page 74 threee worship um I'm assuming that\\npendix b is the housing unit breakdown as guidance so those are currently guidelines provided by The Province\\nthey're not part of the order at this time um as part of the reporting back to the province they've asked for that as\\nsupplemental information which we have provided but they are not part of the order so they have determined these\\nguidelines for all municipalities are just for us they've included it for all\\nthe 10 municipalities correct right so just on um you know in regards to these\\nnumbers um uh below Market uh is\\n657 units of below Market is that that's\\nrental units right okay so below Market according to\\nthe province is determined by number of rental units which are at or below 30%\\nof local housing income so it's called Hills it's a program um so 30% below\\nMarket um but rental units Market the guideline is\\n1,541 the strata units are\\n1,297 so I have to ask the question and this was one of the biggest disappointments with this legislation\\nthat the provincial government has laid out is that they didn't focus on the 30%\\nbelow Market rental to create affordability the\\nlargest part of the um Supply that will be coming online will still be Market\\nwill still be Market rental a a studio in lower Lawnsdale right now is well\\nlast year it was $2900 a month for a studio in low still\\n2900 like who can afford $2,900 that's a mortgage payment not not rental how can\\na young person working you know in gr mountain or Seymour or you know capalo\\nsuspension bridge how can they afford to pay $3,000 a month you know plus\\nutilities and just life the fun stuff right maybe getting a car your first car\\nright so the province is focused on giving us guidelines um and only shooting for a\\nthird of the market units for rental affordability I would have been all over\\nchampioning the legislation if the province had said we're going to require\\n30% of units in all strata and Rental uh projects to be 30% below Market to be\\naffordable um but we were utterly disappointed to find out that this legislation and the\\nremoval of our municipalities all the municipalities in this province zoning\\nPowers which is the one power that we have is land use the province has\\nremoved that from our ability um and they are um not focusing on affordable\\nhousing which and we've done it the mayor of uh bernabe Mike Hurley he is\\none of the fastest growing municipalities in the Lower Mainland he said we've done density they are\\nbuilding 30 40 50 60 story Towers he said it's not bringing the price down\\nnothing's happening to the cost of those units they continue to go up so this the\\nsupply and demand uh rule of uh decades ago is not working in this community why\\nbecause when you have three ski hills in your backyard when you have beaches um at your door doorstep when you have\\nworldclass Trails uh when you were an hour and a half away from one of the um greatest places to ski in the world uh\\nthere is a price to that location location location um I'm disappointed\\nthat um The Province doesn't trust us we've been doing this for a long time we spent millions of dollars creating a\\ncommunity plan um looking at Town centers to drive density and uh we've\\nbeen fighting for affordability and um unfortunately we're losing and uh I don't think that the plan that\\nthe province has is is helping thank you councelor I will just\\nsay you know be careful what we wish for I mean the challenge is that while these\\nare currently guidelines um uh they are um they're not\\nrequirements under the order um and if the government just simply made them requirements under the order without\\nproviding the source of funds to attain that that affordability then they're going to assume that we're going to be\\nusing our tax base to be paying for bringing down the the housing cost which means we' have to raise taxes on\\neverybody in order to produce non-market affordable units in the mix um the you\\nknow the the studies that we have that suggest that the um we would have to\\nproduce nine full Market units in order to be able to actually have uh if you\\ntake a a little bit off of each one and put it into um an affordable unit then\\num it would take nine Market in order to pay for one unit to be um meet our definition of affordable housing and so\\num the you know if you go into Towers you get a ratio of five to one um the\\nguidelines suggest that we're going to produce one to one um and I there's no\\nuh path to doing that um with the resources that are available to us from um our own um capabilities the\\nprogramming Federal programming all of the agencies that we work with through BC housing cmhc metro Vancouver uh\\nthere's no path to that one to one and so if if it did become an order then I\\nthink the assumption would be that we would raise property taxes to have to pay for that affordability which is\\nobviously counter uh because you you'd be raising everybody's costs as well so\\num at this point we're we're focusing on what's in the order and then trying to identify what is just healthy for our\\ncommunity going forward I think a healthy Community has a mixture of uh tenure options and um uh uh sizes and\\nshapes and all kinds of things so that people can move through the through the community um but there's no way that you\\nwe have a path towards a onetoone um uh delivery of affordable units uh it just\\nit's it it would take a tremendous amount of um of public benefit to\\nproduce that obviously where we contribute land we um we try to seek as\\nlow cost as we can uh as deep dive social and affordable housing where we can but um I don't see a path towards a\\none: one uh available to us uh councelor M additional\\ncomments I don't have anyone else in the speaker list um I guess my point mayor\\nlittle is that um your microphone on okay oh\\num I think mayor little my point is is um and I think there's um some uh uh\\nwhere you look on the graph I'm not sure if it's in the housing targets graph from The Province or if it's within our\\nown but the loss of units the net loss of units of affordable housing so if we\\nwere to include um the number of units that were lost through Redevelopment for instance like Emery how many units we\\nlost up there um you know that would have played into a a better way to look\\nat this this whole picture rather than assuming when you tear something down and build something new even if it is\\nbelow Market somehow it's going to be better for the community in our case and in many municipalities it wasn't better\\nit was worse um I understand we don't have a path forward but it seems to me\\nthat we as municipalities um within the new legislation are being asked to do more and um I wish that the same\\nrequirement within the velopment community and I understand the issues of the costs the challenge behind the one:1\\nbut hindsight the 2020 it's too bad we didn't you know push further and try to\\nprotect the affordable housing that we had instead of tearing it down and displacing it and hence we find\\nourselves in this very challenging situation um and I guess the other thing that the provincial government I wish\\nthat they would look at is you know maintaining existing rental that's affordable old rental and requiring\\nowners and land Lords to protect that level of housing through increased maintenance I know it costs money but it\\nis it's a business and uh the more we rip down the more displaced um we're\\ngoing to find more of a our population in and that's not good for anyone thank you counselor I see no further speakers\\non the matter I'm prepared to call the question all in favor contrary minded motion is carried thank you very much uh\\n8.7 Traffic Calming Solutions in Edgemont Village\\nitem 8.5 was passed in consent at the beginning of the meeting item 8.6 was referred to the end of the meeting so\\nwe'll be doing 8.7 and 8.8 uh before uh next uh next item 8.7 is the traffic\\ncalming solutions for Edgemont Village uh councelor muy this is your\\nreport um so I bring this I bring this motion forward um there was a motion\\nthat uh Council brought forward uh last year a year and a half ago um and we uh\\nit was a motion that was unanimously um passed it was talking about the speed in\\nEdgemont and I'm asking staff to bring forward solutions to deal with that speed uh we had a report that staff\\nbrought forward in regards to um the fact that um uh the speed had really not\\nchanged within the Edgmont Highland area um they did some data collection from outside the area and we had a workshop\\nand talked more about 30 kilometer zones in the rest of the municipality than focusing in on the area of Edgemont um I\\nthink many of us on Council um had a concern that the issues that were\\npresented within that uh Council motion were not dealt with by staff and um so\\nwe had the workshop and then I um uh moved to bring forward\\nuh motion to be a little bit clearer um that Council and the community the\\nbusiness Community the Community Association the surrounding community of Edgemont is very interested in slowing\\ntraffic down um we were um uh under the\\nimpression that staff believed that there was a warrant for a full traffic light on Edgemont and Highland Boulevard\\nand that caused a great concern within the community Association uh the business Business Association in\\nEdgemont and um ourselves and so this motion is um asking staff to look at\\neverything but a full light at Edgemont and Highland and certainly safety is of\\nthe utmost importance but we recognize that there are many Tools in uh the\\nengineering toolkit to look at slowing traffic down that is raised uh raised\\nspeed tables uh speed bumps curb bulges pedestrian activated uh light certainly\\nwalking across uh Edgemont the boulevard is um difficult especially seniors\\nwalking from one sidewalk to the next there's two rows of angled parking two lanes and a median and certainly um\\npedestrian activated signal would be um something that we would absolutely\\nsupport um we are also um aware of um\\nthe warrants for and this is not in the motion but if somebody's willing to um\\nuh uh if the seconder is willing to uh approve uh a friendly amendment I would\\nalso ask staff to report back on the installation of a full light at Frederick and Mountain um we have some\\nconcerns that rat running would um be created through that installation um I think Council many of\\nus have been talking about these issues putting full lights in we're trying to slow people down but we also don't want\\npeople going into the outside neighbor neighborhoods um we do need to have a workshop on this going forward mayor\\nlittle um but certainly um the ambience of the village is uh not conducive to\\nanother light in the center of it and we would ask staff um that they come back\\num with funding options and alternatives to a full light at Edgmont and also\\nreport back on Frederick second it I'm actually going to intercede a little bit on the on the\\naddition of Frederick so I uh it it's not in the original report it's not something that Council was warned about\\nit's not something that staff had an opportunity to comment on it so at this point I'm going to consider that portion\\nis being out of order with the original motion uh but um we can definitely um uh\\nwork towards getting staff prepared and and and Reporting back on that um but I\\nI wouldn't take the decision without having staff had an opportunity to investigate the matter and talk about\\nthe state of things there so so I I think I would be willing to allow it to be um that it would be the initial the\\noriginal motion but then also uh that um that staff report back on feasibility\\noptions for Traffic Control at Frederick that we would be asking for that that would be with that I don't\\nthink that that's actually um making the decision on it it's just going to get us more information be okay with that is\\nthat okay to the seconder yes thank you very much okay thank you very councelor\\nmury has actually I guess officially now you're the seconder okay uh councelor Pope additional comments thank you very\\nmuch uh I support this motion I don't think anyone wants to see a traffic light at Highland and Edgemont uh and I\\nwould also like to propose uh an amendment um and that Amendment would be\\nto direct staff to use dnv's 2014 Edgmont plan and design guidelines when\\nimplementing Solutions this was a report that was created uh extend ensive\\nconsultation with the community with experts with planners with our staff in\\n2014 uh to increase the safety while also providing a vision for Edgemont\\nVillage to be more welcoming pedestrian friendly and\\nbeautiful so I would like to put that Amendment on the table and um I have\\nmore to say on it seconded okay and so on the amendment this is to\\nuh use the 2014 plan to guide the implementation of traffic calming and\\nservices around the area is that amendable to the original yeah C certainly staff would refer to that\\ndocument as it's as it's within you know the uh the district forw doesn't sound like it's in conflict with the original\\nmotion so I'm okay with that it's accepted okay so then um uh I'll call\\nthe question on the amendment is there any other discuss discussion on the amendment that's now been moved and secreted by councilor pop and\\nM yes I would like to have further discussion on on the amendment yeah please okay thank you um so this\\namendment actually broadens the scope and provides more of a vision for Edgmont and not just one corner of it um\\nand the reason I'm pursuing the discussion of it here is because uh actually this report has sat on the\\nShelf Gathering dust for 10 years um and so I want to make it clear at this point\\nthat um this is this is what we want um that we want a vision and we want\\nspecific guidelines on how to create spaces in edgman Edgemont so it's safer\\npedestrian friendly inclusive and beautiful like a little village in Europe and all of that is in this report\\nfrom 2014 it will also attract local and international visitors and\\nmake it a hub for families interaction with neighbors and\\nfun um so many examples of what could be\\ndone uh can already be found in lower lawdale the city of Vancouver and around\\nthe world and guess what 10 years after those Initial Ideas came out the\\nresearch is in and it turns out that just by putting in paint Otherwise Known\\nthese days as ashalt art a street can be made safer and I have a video that two\\nminutes short uh that I want to play if we could do that from\\nthe gives some examples here we go of what can be done\\nso I guess we don't have\\naudio n right these\\nare visuals of cities around the world that as you can see have engaged\\ncitizens and uh laid out plans for painting and the most astounding thing\\nis um a study published in the Washington Post post found that because\\nof these efforts um a 50% reduction in crashes involving pedestrians and\\ncyclists and a 27% increase in drivers yielding to\\npedestrians uh with the right of way just because of paint so uh to me I don't think we\\nshould just be focusing focusing on engineered Solutions and instead take\\ntake the advice of some very smart people who used to work in this building and a few who probably still do and plan\\nto implement some of these ideas starting with\\npaint or those foam bricks they had on April 1 where you walked across the crosswalk and you held a brick and you\\nmade people stop okay thank you very much uh\\ncouncilor mury you the second on the amendment is that okay uh councelor back are you for the\\namendment to the main motion I want to speak to both on the amendment first I'll get\\nanother opportunity on the me thank you thank you very much and thank you councelor muy for bringing the motion forward um I too uh want to see uh I do\\ndo not want to see a new Full signal there at Highlands in Edgemont um I certainly want to see um traffic cing in\\nEdgmont Village um and as we saw from your motion that you brought forward and the 30k pilot uh a 30k speed limit alone\\ndoes not slow down drivers um traffic signals um give priority to Vehicles\\nover pedestrians and I've always thought that uh Edgemont Village um could be so\\nmuch more uh could be so much more of a people oriented vibrant space uh where where families kids felt safe um and I\\nalways like to com use the the analogy that if a community is safe for kids it's safe for just about anybody um and\\nI've never felt that that uh core of of of the village is and so I do think it's\\nphysical infrastructure that's needed but um as it was highlighted here in in councelor Pope's Amendment there's so\\nmuch that can be done with just paint um and uh and so I I would love to see um\\nthis amendment and this motion be the start of a of a bit of a transformation\\nof Edgmont into into a village that's much more as I say people oriented in a place that um is just not so car doin\\nand yes it's about slowing down speeds and I think that's you know that's at the heart of how we start this um but\\nthen it's about creating um activating the space uh through the way it's it's\\nengineered through the types of programming that will'll you know be able to offer in in some of the expanded\\nareas that are not so much about um cars so um very support of of seeing this be\\nthe direction of how we um slow down traffic through the village and uh and\\nvery supportive of it thank you thank you very much on the amendment any further discussion to call the question\\non the amendment all those in favor contrary minded motion is carried the item is amended back to the original\\nmotion um uh councelor back you had some additional comments on the original motion\\num I think um I'm hoping that we can see how the funding will work here I know\\nwith the TransLink funding it was tied to the full signal but I'm hoping that staff will be able to um report back on\\nhow we could potentially apply some of that funding towards a different traffic calming solution um but uh no I think\\nI've kind of covered in my previous comments I just don't think that a traffic signal is is going to um create\\nthis the safety that we want uh in that area of the village we just um some of my own\\ncomments on the matter um you know we I I'm always cautious about us getting\\ninto making a political decision around a safety matter um I think we we do\\nalways have to um refer to our experts to advise us on what's appropriate but\\nagain there's more than one way to achieve our safety goals in the community um unless you have a very\\nextreme situation uh we're obviously not going to in and around a highway exchange we're probably not going to\\nrely on paint to manage uh manage risk in Affairs but in in Village context and\\ntown centers it's something that could could be very functional um so I I'm\\nvery cautious about us um interfering where a warrant study has said that we have to upgrade something and we make a\\npolitical decision not to upgrade something or that we make a political decision to do something uh dramatically\\ndifferent that doesn't have the same kind of um outcomes having said that um I will be supportive of uh this matter\\ngenerally um I I'm I will put back out there if if if\\nthe experts feel that there's there's no way this can adequately protect\\nresidents or it misdirects residents into a riskier situation that I do want them to be reporting back to us on on\\nthat matter I would not want to create a situation where uh that's an issue um\\nyou know when you think about accessibility in our community and I've spent a tremendous amount of time on the\\nadvisory committee on disabilities issues um we have some leading\\ntechnologies that we use uh called apps which is The Pedestrian signal system the chirps and beeps and stuff that we\\nhave at our uh intersections in our town that's something that lots of other places don't have and it helps remove\\nbarriers to people in need to uh move around the community so um you know as\\nwe look at upgrades to the Edgemont area there may be something said to make some of the decisions based on General\\naccessibility um in the community uh combined with safety um uh but I also\\nworry that the um a full signalization of this intersection um would fairly dramatically change uh the feel of this\\narea and you're already between two signalized intersections um in the in the space so uh I'm open to uh using e\\nother methods whether it's paint or whether it's um race crosswalks or signalization of a more modest nature\\nyou be pedestrian oriented signals or or others um I will also say that you know\\none of the things that we've got four kids in the community and and I tell them not to trust paint um uh just\\nbecause a crosswalk is painted doesn't mean you still don't have to make eye contact with the driver um and just\\nbecause we've done a lovely big mural outside of brymar elementary school is an example it doesn't mean that that's a\\nplay space for pedestrians in any way shape or form you still have to uh recognize the inherent risk of being\\nsharing your space with a vehicle um because it is inherently risky for pedestrians to be in the same space so\\ndon't trust paint uh but it does help to um uh\\nto elevate the awareness of drivers to pedestrians moving through that space and so it's generally a good a positive\\nthing so I'll be supportive of this um and look forward to hearing back from our staff about um uh what treatment\\nthey would recommend in the space uh as an interm measure uh councelor Forbes\\nadditional comments thank you worship um yeah just\\na couple comments um I think everything that's been said\\nis good I agree with you mayor that when it comes down to actual safety I think\\nthat's something we have to look to our engineers and our experts for that's not our expertise around Council so um with\\nthat in mind I'd also like to say that I I have been a proponent of updating a\\nlot of Dusty um reports sitting on shelves and so I'm really glad that this\\nhas come forward and but I would also like to encourage staff then to look at the 2014 report in light of 10 years\\nlater because we do have a lot more traffic there's different kind of Housing and Development that is now\\nthere in Edgemont so 2014 study is a great start um but just to look at it in\\nthe way the situation is now 10 years later and then just sort of adding one\\nmore thing we just talked about paint two weeks ago and how uh the paint used\\ndown at the exchange by Modi is gone disappeared we we've also had um some of\\nour uh Pride sidewalks where the paint disappears in two years and Council Mary\\nbrought forward um information about possible um paints that would last\\nlonger and would illuminate at night so I'd like to ask when staff looks at this\\nthat they also look at that a different type of paint more last long lasting\\nlonger if that's the route we go and also again because we've been talking\\nbudgets the cost of that kind of implementation thank you thank you very\\nmuch uh I see no further speakers but we have had some changes to the motion that are not actually on the screen yet so\\nI've asked jenevie if she would be willing to uh uh read out the amended motion thank you through your worship\\nthe amended motion on the floor right now is that Council direct staff to implement engineering solutions to calm\\ntraffic in Edgemont Village rather than the proposed traffic signal at Edgemont in Highline Boulevard and that Council\\ndirect staff to report back on funding options for proposed engineered Solutions and that coun and that staff\\nreport back on feasibility options for Traffic Control at Frederick and that Council direct staff to use DMV's 2014\\nEdgemont plan and design guidelines when implementing solutions to increase safety while also making Edgemont\\nVillage more welcoming pedestrian friendly and beautiful Frederick at Mountain Highway\\nthank you okay is everyone clear on the motion being considered at this time okay\\nprepare to call the question all those in favor contrary minded motion carries thank you very much bio break okay the\\n8.8 Pickleball Courts Expansion\\nnext item up for discussion is uh item 8.8 this is the pickle pole pts\\nexpansion councelor Pope it's your your report would you like to make your motion\\nplease uh my motion is to uh V Council direct staff to identify sites where new\\noutdoor pickle ball courts could be located and where current courts could\\nbe expanded in the district of North Vancouver is there seconder on that motion seconded by councelor back okay\\nCouncil Pope your comments thank you very much well as some of you know around this table and in the audience I\\nplay a little pickle ball I discovered it during covid and\\nlike so many others I became a pickle ball addict quite quickly\\nit keeps me and other players active it gets us off the couch exercising and\\nsocializing it's cheap and accessible with the only investment being a paddle\\nuh and of course it's tons of fun the social aspect is noteworthy because that\\nis what makes it different than other court Sports and as we learned during\\ncovid socialization is critical to our mental health and well-being right now\\nthere are not enough pickle ball courts to meet current let alone future demand\\nin the district of North Vancouver we players know it because we see the throngs of people showing up at\\ncourts across the NorthShore and often lining up to play and we also know it\\nbecause the soon to be released Sport Court strategy has also come to the same\\nconclusion I'll pick up on more on that in a moment pickle ball is the fastest\\ngrowing sport in North America and based on Regional and worldwide Trends its\\npopularity will continue surging exponentially while adults 58 uh aged 55\\nplus popularized the sport players aged 18 to 34 now represent the largest\\ngrowth in numbers in fact well over 2,000 norshore students plus their\\nteachers have been introduced to pickleball in the last three years alone and local schools are acquiring paddles\\nand teaching pickle ball as part of their curriculum so regarding the Sports Court\\nstrategy a highlevel presentation on the strategy was presented to the parks\\ncommittee which I attended last week the report comes to the conclusion that\\nindeed we need more pickle ball court so I feel if we know that then let's get\\nmoving a few locations have been identified but there are many more\\npossibilities that could be explored some courts could be expanded on their\\ncurrent lo locations quite easily just by painting some lines the painting\\ntheme tonight so but just by painting some lines on the current Courts at\\nlittle katees for example they could easily add two more on the current surface and we also need to look for\\nplaces where there could P potentially be pickle ball hubs or centers of at\\nleast eight courts pickle ball players as we heard earlier tonight uh from some\\nof the players that spoke pickle ball players like gathering in groups to play lots of games with lots of different\\nplayers and that's why pickle ball hubs are the way most cities are going these\\ndays bernabe Richmond Ando and many more are creating pickle ball hubs and\\nthey're relatively easy to build because eight pickle ball courts have a\\nfootprint comparable to two tennis courts so to sum up what my motion does\\nis ask staff to identify locations where additional courts could go as a hub or\\nwhere current courts could be expanded and then to bring forward a Report with\\ncosts by then we should have the official Sports Court strategy and the north van W commission's facilities\\nstrategy and that will help us make decisions that balance the needs of All\\nSport Sports Court Sports Court players say that three\\ntimes and some of this work could be done immediately so again now that we need\\nmore pickle ball courts let's get staff moving in that direction and I hope that voting yes to this\\nmotion will enable that to happen thank you okay thank you very much I believe\\nthe seconder on the matter was Council back Council back thank you Mary little um so I will be supporting the\\nrecommendation here tonight uh and thank you councelor Pope for bringing the report forward um I myself am not a\\npickle ball player but I've certainly followed the massive uh growth that this sport has uh has seen in recent years\\nnot just in our community but all the world and uh for all the reasons that you've outlined I I I want to see uh\\nmore opportunities for people to to play the sport um I think anything that gets people um active at at any stage age or\\nstage of life is is something that we need to be promoting um and there's the physical as well as the the huge social\\nconnection piece which I think is more important than ever um that we provide opportunities for people to to gather\\nand and connect uh in person um you know I think things change uh at one time\\ntennis was very much a a dominant sport in our community um we have a lot of\\ntennis courts um and I'll be interested to um read the sport court strategy once\\nthat does come forward um to council um to see how the demand for tennis looks\\nright now but you know I I think that um we we have a lot of tennis courts as was\\nhighlighted by one of the speakers uh in various parts of the district um and I I\\ndo support shared usage wherever we can um but as I say times change Trends\\nchange and and right now pickle ball is is really surging ahead um so I think it's it's time to look at how we can you\\nknow create more facilities and expand um current pick aall facilities um\\nrecognizing that you know it's it is seeing such such huge growth um I know in in residential areas uh or courts\\nthat are close to residential areas the noise is is an issue um so you know I I\\nunderstand that there's rackets now that are quite a bit quieter and that's a there's a local connection to that particular invention which I'd love to\\nlearn more about um but you know it's something to consider when we look at where these sorts of ports are located\\nbut um I absolutely support um you know exploring how we can uh create more um\\nin terms of the sport court strategy just in in sort of the initial look that was uh given by by our parks and\\nenvironment committee last week it looks as though pickle ball you know did uh did show up in that strategy um so I\\nthink any work that is initiated through this uh recommendation tonight would would feed into that quite nicely so I\\ndon't think it's working against that strategy it would be really informing it um so I'm happy to support\\nit thank you very much uh councelor back councelor Hansen your comments yeah thank you very much I I uh\\nagree with uh all the we've heard from councilors Pope and councelor back I\\nnever played pickable but when I hear about these remarkable athletic and\\nsocial benefits it it may be that u i i i find myself playing pickle wall very\\nsoon I agree there aren't enough courts that's a a message that we do hear from our community and I do support the uh\\ncall for more courts uh we are of course going to have to consider overall cost\\num we've been told that pickle ball coats are reasonably coste effective but\\num as dying end with other discussions in the evening we do have to be careful\\nat this stage as to initiating new and expensive programs uh and we also need\\nto uh be careful about the way that we're reallocating uh these spaces away from\\ntennis but potentially also away from other uh Community uh needs U just\\nbecause very fashionable right now doesn't mean I think we should um give it a a\\npriority that's out of proportion given all of the different user groups across\\nthe district but thank you councel for bringing the motion I do support uh the call for more pickle courts in North\\nDistrict and I look forward to the report councelor Hansen councelor\\nForbes thank you worship um it was about six years ago the first time\\nI got a phone call from people who played pickle ball and it was at little Kate's and I got involved with those\\npeople out there a little bit and at the time I think there you also understood\\nyou were involved in the fact that uh they were trying to get pickall courts there solely pickall court pickall\\ncourts because of the lineups when the tennis courts the other set of Courts tennis courts were sitting empty and\\nthere was a great C buffle between tennis court users and pickle Court\\nusers so I do think that the um Sports Court strategy that the rec center is\\ndoing which involves the rec center facilities with the District of northan\\nand the City of northan I think that's really really important for us to take a\\narching overall look at it not just focusing on just the district but everywhere and where we can place them\\num I also think at that time too there was a lot of a lot of uproar about the noise\\nof the sport so I think we still have to be sensitive um I'm glad that there's new equipment out that has progressed\\nand made it a little bit quieter but we need to be sensitive about where we're putting them\\num the um I just lost my train of thought anyway I'm in favor of anything\\nthat's going to keep our kids out active our adults out active\\nand in the fresh air um so I'm looking forward to the strategy Court strategy\\nthing to make a big difference a global difference on the NorthShore hopefully\\nWest Vancouver is not included because I think they were at six years ago West Vancouver was not in favor of pickleball\\ncourts I don't know where they' come cor I don't know where they've come but it would be really nice if they get on\\nboard too anyway thank you thank you councelor Forbes councelor\\nMo thank you I think I'm going to borrow a term from one of the earlier speakers\\nfrom the uh public input SE uh section I would consider myself an emerging player\\nI started playing pickle ball last year and I can see firsthand why people enjoy it the game is very social and people\\nget out I'm now playing on a regular basis many of you know that\\nthe northan recreation and culture commission slated to come back to council with a\\ncomprehensive Recreation and Sport facility plan later this year it will cover Fields facilities and\\ncourts including pickleball courts we as a council has also been\\napproached by other members of the community about the need to complete the handsworth artificial turf\\nfield build cover skateboard parks so borders can skate in the fall and in the\\nwinter months and I've been approach about uh providing a facility for field\\nhockey I've also heard from residents who would love to have King a kerning ring back in the\\ndistrict we as a council need to represent the entire community at the last Council workshop\\non tax distribution many members of council spoke about spending within our\\nmeans we can't do everything this is especially relevant\\non the heels of this year's 7% property tax increase in the pending situation with the NorthShore wastewater treatment\\nplan I don't want to make promises now that Council cannot\\nkeep I want to be clear I enjoy playing pickle ball however I think it' be more\\nappropriate to make decisions about sport facilities and direction to staff after Council receives the report from\\nthe commission thank you very much councelor Mary uh thank you mayor uh\\nlittle I almost called you mayor Bell oh I haven't done that in a long time uh\\nI'm just wondering if uh staff can comment in regards to um I was I'm a\\ncouncil's rep on the parks and natural environment committee and Parks uh made a presentation in regards to um the\\nissue of pickle ball at the meeting uh last week and we had a member of uh\\npickle Bal Community was there as well um and I'm just wondering if you can talk about the Synergy with what this\\nmotion is intending which is what we're already doing I think and then maybe speak to the um work that we're doing\\nwith the rec Commission on the needs assessment and uh the\\nalignment Miss Warner thank you through your worship um\\nyes so as um Council Mary has uh indicated we have a number of um\\ninitiatives underway uh including looking at the full in ventory of\\nrecreation amenities and that's work that we have uh underway in partnership with North Van W and city of North\\nVancouver um our work looking at the district sport courts which includes uh\\ntennis pickle ball lacrosse basketball all sports that use our outdoor hard\\ncourt surfaces that work began some years ago um as the district uh\\nrecognized the growing needs of a variety of sports including pickle ball and reference to Lil Kates has been made\\nwhere we've made uh great improvements over the last couple years to help meet that need in the E semr area so these\\nbodies of work are both underway concurrently with the district's work to analyze its existing inventory of\\nsupport courts uh having Advanced sooner um but concurrent to this broader piece\\nof work so the work that we're doing um is concurrent and\\ncomplimentary um we are analyzing our existing inventory and looking at the potential uh within it to optimize for All Sports\\nand that work will support the broader analysis that's underway with our\\npartners across North Vancouver and North vanre commission at the full inventory of indoor and outdoor um sport\\ncourts and other uh Sport and Recreation amenities available for All Sports and\\ndo you have an indication as to when we can expect um that information to come back to both all three bodies Rec\\nMission um you may not be able to speak to that I'm not sure if Miss Turner and Mr Hunter's on the phone maybe Mr Joyce\\num can speak to that um but the uh the body of work with this yeah with all\\nthree what how how What's the timing on that this Warner three your worship um\\nour timing on analysis of the district's Sport Court inventory specifically uh we\\nanticipate having concluded that analysis with recommendation to council um we're aiming for early summer\\n2024 um the information that we bring forward at that time will also be considered uh within that broader\\nanalysis and work that's underway with North Van recre uh the timing of their process uh given the magnitude and scope\\nof that work I can't speak to that um it's it's much deeper analysis but both\\nbodies of work will be complimentary and we're working very closely to ensure that thank you very much so I think the\\num the motion that's been brought forward as councelor back said that this is not not in in uh conflict with as as\\nwe move forward this work is already being done um uh that information will\\nbe coming back to the council's or to our Council for discussion in regards to the sports Court it did sort of Jump\\nAhead um in regards to the needs assessment the rec commission was looking at and certainly um the\\nrelationship that we have with the city of North Vancouver um you know it's a a very good one we've worked very closely\\nover the years with our partnership uh with the rec commission and we're looking at the whole holistic uh\\ninventory of amenities that we have between both municipalities and uh\\nworking towards making sure that they're all complimentary to one another and um as other counselors have talked about\\nmaking sure that we can find balance within the community uh for all the needs that um people are interested in I\\nmean I can add rock climbing to the list uh beach volleyball um Highline you know\\nthe list goes on of all of the new um ways people want to recreate we are also\\nmapping the dark side um in the Seymour ongoing maintenance of our Trails we\\nhave one of the most extensive Trail networks um in the world and uh it's uh\\nit's something that um you know takes a lot of resources uh to be able to\\nmaintain we're working with um our partners within the provincial government currently there's one planner\\nfor the entire south coast region um for Parks so it's challenging um so so we\\nhave a lot on our plate um but we look forward to this body of work and um certainly this report um is just\\naccentuating what is already going on thank you thank you councilor mury um uh\\njust my own comments on the matter um you know I was happy to support the\\nBerto Fraser project when those spaces were created obviously very happy to support the um the katees park uh\\nproject and and then we kind of had to pause to try to figure out what to do for Central North Vancouver um we\\nobviously don't want people to have to commute all over the community to be able to find it but you want to get a critical mass of Parts together to be\\nable to do um uh to make to make it a great experience for people um and so we\\nwe kind of pause there um I do think that we need to create more um pickle\\nball capacity within the community um I want to be very very cautious about us\\nalways making it at the expense of tennis um I know the tennis community is\\nunder under pressure I know that's that's sometimes the easiest thing to do is to just take it over because it's\\nalready flat space in the community um but um tennis has seen growth too\\nalthough largely in their indoor spaces um and we don't necessarily need to have the direct conflict um between the two\\nI'll put something on the table that's a little bit controversial we'll say um which is to say that we have 54 Sports\\nfields in the district of North vanc couver uh we've been converting over to at fields to get uh a higher level of\\nusage each week the old the grass fields would only get about 10 hours of use before they would deteriorate um but if\\nthe soccer Community doesn't want to be using our gravel Fields anymore they prefer to go to the artificial turf\\nfields then it would suggest that that in the relatively near future we'll have Surplus gravel fields and that's been a\\nvery very dramatic change that we've seen in the last 10 years is that those\\nspaces um uh the clubs now are only signing up for our at uh spaces for the\\nkids development programs which is a huge user on those areas and so it may mean that we don't always have to take\\nfrom tennis we can we can look at um uh the other spaces in the community where\\nwe have underutilized gravel fields and say it's already a flat note space maybe we can do something else uh with it um\\nif it's Surplus to our needs um so I I don't want this to just always be conflict between tennis and pickle ball\\nthere's no reason that we can't over time uh make sure that both space both Sports have uh adequate spaces to um uh\\nto recreate in our community um I do think that the right place for\\nthis is in the context of the broader needs assessment study um committing to\\na project and then going and studying its place in the rest of um of the system doesn't sounds out of order to me\\num it's something that we should be um going to the um needs assessment first um which won't take long it's\\nalready underway it's already something that's being developed and so um uh we\\ncould get the benefit of that study uh before we move forward but again the the location's got to be something that\\ncombines uh convenience the reason why we picked cases as an example was because uh ready available of parking\\nready available of washrooms ready availability of washrooms in the space relatively flat get in and out and it\\nwas limited in terms of exposure to neighboring residential areas that you didn't have uh uh that conflict and\\nobviously we mitigated that with the sound fencing and other stuff that we we've done there um so it's it's it's\\nhard to find a totally uh great spot for pickle ball but I think uh if we\\nactually are studying our broader needs assessment I think we're going to find that uh we actually do have some uh\\nother suitable Alternatives that uh that we may not have looked at in the past particularly um potentially the flat\\nareas created by our um gravel Fields so um I'll I'll be supportive but I think\\nthis needs to be in the context of the um of the study and so I'll look to\\nstaff for their response to that actually maybe if I I know I'm out of time but just quick comment from staff\\nabout the timing and that and and how we can incorporate that same thing for the\\nsummer um so as mentioned our work to look at optimization of the district's\\num existing inventory um that work is is well underway and well Advanced and it considers also um our work that we're\\ndoing uh together with mvrc and cnv on that broader uh assessment that's been\\nreferenced this evening and our we're sharing our data together also amongst\\nthe um staff and consultant teams so um we can bring forward um preliminary uh\\nevaluation of the district's existing inventory uh we anticipate by summer\\nokay thank you very much uh second speaker profor\\nPope thank you very much and I must say Mr Mayor I love your idea of using the\\ngravel field for other uses and especially a pickle ball\\nHub there you go um so I'm hearing early summer we're\\ngoing to get one report the other report isn't coming in until the end of the year which sounds like the New Year to\\nme which sounds like 2025 and we already know\\ntoday April 2024 that we need more pickle ball courts\\ntoday um so the demand we have now can't wait for study more\\nreports um when we already know what how what the conclusion is um uh and I\\nwanted to just add a couple of things um the costs as well for pickle ball courts\\nare minimal especially when you look at just expanding some of the ones that currently exist but also it's um you\\nknow again it's the the size of you know two tennis courts is equal to eight\\npickle ball courts so you can accommodate the need uh quite easily um\\nbut the other thing is the noise uh I realize we have to be cognizant of the\\nneighbors and where the pickle ball courts go which is why the location becomes especially difficult um and I\\nappreciate all the work that staff have done uh so far on their reports um we\\nknow in the pickle ball community that and I believe that the future of pickle ball is in these newly designed um\\nrackets which I happen to have one and it's 50% quieter so if everybody's\\nplaying with these kinds of rackets uh it'll make a very big difference and\\nalso the sound barriers are also improving and I just wanted to add those\\nfew comments thank you councelor Forbes additional comments\\nI just want to say I like your idea of the gravel fields too because nobody really wants to play on them anymore so\\nthey're prepped I mean we'd have we'd have to do a little more but it I'd\\nstill like to go back to also something else you said that I don't like making isolated decisions I like getting all of\\nthe information and then making the decision and that's the best\\nfiscally uh and environmentally way to make a decision\\nand it's too bad that we come to these real I mean six years ago people were asking for pick all courts then so it's\\ntoo bad that it we seem to get to the breaking point before we say okay now we're going to do something but I don't\\nthink that should negate the idea of doing it responsibly so I would I'm looking forward to the the full study\\nand how our the district can continue doing um their evaluation on our our\\ncourts but I'm looking for the whole study and how their our evaluation will fit into that thank you thank you counc\\nback additional comments just as I seconded the recommendation I wanted to highlight that I don't think we're\\nactually making any decisions through this recommendation all it's being asked is that staff are able to report back um\\nwith identifying some new and existing sites um so I'm okay with with that\\ncoming forward um with a little bit more urgency than you necessarily waiting for\\nthe whole strategy um that's all I would say is that um I think we can probably\\ndo that we all agree that it's not it's not going against the sport court strategy so I would just like to\\nemphasize that it needs a little bit more urgency than waiting for all the\\npieces okay uh thank you very much um yeah I I I will say you know I I took\\nthe motion to be the same largely that it it recommend back um identifying sites but as councelor Hansen said it\\nwas a great gate there's a there's a there's a capital question in this which is um that it it has to go through a\\nbudget process it can't simply just be about the council just directing on on a\\nshort whim that we're going to make these kinds of change it has to be through a capital process we have to see it in the context of the other\\npriorities for a community um I I I don't think that has to be a long process I heard that the report would be\\nby Summer I think that's not unreasonable um and um you know we also\\nhave the capability to uh use temporary courts to expand our capacity at\\ndifferent times whether that's indoor spaces with temporary courts um or we for the longest time use temporary\\ncourts um um before we had built the dedicated spaces uh I'm not a big fan of\\nmulti- lining uh I think that just breeds contempt and conflict in the community I think that um it does have\\nto be dedicated separated uh pickle ball space and just as we've had the benefit of dedicated separated tennis space in\\nthe community um one of the big advantages I think we brought forward the last time we expanded was that um we\\nno longer had to have uh you know uh alter the the the Nets where people were\\nputting weights on the Nets to get them to be the right size that people were doing markings on the ground to to\\nchange uh the tennis spaces I don't think that's desirable either um it it should be dedicated separated not\\nmulti-lined uh this should be for pickle ball space where I'm with my 20 15\\nseconds left I will just say that you know one of the debates we had at the time that we talked about murof Fraser\\nwas what you know how much we should focus on development and short commutes to the infrastructure that we have\\nversus creating that Central tournament facility um and I still think that we we\\nprobably should be uh focusing on just making it accessible to people so they don't have to commute long distances um\\nand that the uh tournament size facility uh may be something that we pursue in the longer run um but um uh no I I still\\nthink this is generally right direction I've been happy to support pickle ball in the past I just uh want to do it in a way that's not always in conflict with\\nuh our tennis community as well uh Council Forbes your name is up I think that's from before is that\\ncorrect okay I see no further speakers on the matter prepared to call the question all those in favor contrary\\nminded remot contary minded okay councelor M's contary minded okay uh\\nmotion carries with councelor ma opposed okay uh moving on to item 8.6 uh\\nfirst okay so at nine o'clock we normally have a little bit of a break for people to stretch we do only have\\none item and a report left um but if you know let's let's I I I appreciate\\neverybody's waited for a minute we're just going to take a two or three minute bio break for people to be able to\\nstep out and stretch and use the washroom which is across the hall and we will resume immediately um to the item\\nTri\\n[Music]\\nC\\nget\\nthey\\n[Music]\\noh good you definitely saw I had like an ow this morning I was like\\nget yeah\\nthe\\nslides it's in a yeah I got it thank you\\n[Music]\\nthe meeting back to order if council members could take their seats\\nplease sure\\n[Music] all right uh hope everyone had an opportunity to stretch uh we're going to\\n8.6 Deep Cove Parking Review – 2024 Implementation Plan\\ngo into the last item which is 8 8.6 uh this is the uh deep Co parking\\nreview 2024 implementation plan uh very first off the top I've had a member of council indicate that they'd like to\\nrecuse them themselves on the matter counselor uh Hansen if you could read into the record your reasons for recusing yourself on this thank you very\\nmuch uh this goes back to 2014 uh when this issue originally came\\nbefore me I was recently elected and I have since that time uh continue to uh\\ndeclare a potential conflict um I was advised that the source of the conflict\\nis because my spouse and I have a property up Indian Arm and the\\nsuggestion was made that the value of that property the desirability of Indian arm uh ownership and use is contingent\\nin part on parking availability in IND in Deep Cove and I've stayed consistent\\nwith that position so I will continue to recuse myself so because you benefit from a parking pass you'll recuse\\nyourself from there thank you very\\nmuch okay um I understand uh Mr Cohen we have about a five slide presentation to\\num uh to present and then we'll have our discussion so over to you thank you mayor little good evening Council for\\nmembers of the public my name is Peter Cohen and I'm the director of Engineering Services I'm joined this evening by Wendel and Jordan who is our\\nacting manager of Transportation this evening we're coming back to council to present to you\\nstaff's recommended implementation plan to create an incremental Improvement to the parking management strategy in Deep\\nCove to help set the stage for council's discussion and deliberations I'll Just sh share a handful of\\nslides just as an overview the report before you is based on two years of work\\nas part of our work plan to revisit and update the 2015 Deep Cove parking and\\naccess implementation plan the staff recommendation before you this evening is based on data that was collected in\\n2022 public engagement that occurred in early 2023 and several discussions we've\\nhad with Council across the fall and the winter most recently at our workshop on March the\\n18th and lastly for context the study area in question covers the broader Deep Cove neighborhood as shown by the image\\non the left in blue and is generally all areas north and east of the Mount Seymour Parkway and Deep Cove Road\\nintersection as a recap to the staff recommendation the image on the left is\\na reminder that we have approached our implementation recommendation in trying to strike a balance between the parking\\nneeds of residents businesses and visitors in Deep Cove we know that there are many\\nfrustrations within our community as it relates to problematic parking and and circulation within Deep Cove and our\\nrecommendation accommodates the needs of all three groups but we recognize that no single group can get everything that\\nthey desire the proposed recommendation before you is not intended to resolve\\nall of the transportation issues in Deep Cove it's rather intended to be an incremental Improvement and a step in\\nthe right direction the two images on the right hand side provide a snapshot of the changes being proposed by staff\\nkey aspects include a qu Drupal of Resident only on street parking spaces\\nin Deep Cove this is an increase of hundreds of\\nspaces having approximately 70% of all on street parking being prioritized for\\nresidents in some manner there's also a roughly doubling of time limited spaces to encourage higher turnover spaces and\\nalso in maintaining unrestricted on Street spaces that are within walking distance to Key\\ndestinations one key message to remind council is that staff's approach to this proposed parking strategy is by taking a\\nholistic neighborhood level look at this issue usually we would look at parking on a street by- street level as we start\\nto hear complaints and concerns this is no longer effective in Deep Cove as this will simply move the problem around and\\nso the staff recommendation tries to look at a broader strategy that removes a neighborhood a neighbor first neighbor\\nor Street by Street scenario in terms of the feedback that staff heard on March 18th at the\\nworkshop you will see a lot of this reflected in the staff report before you firstly we heard General consensus from\\nCouncil that the previously proposed 10: a.m. start to Any Time restrictions was considered too late staff have made\\nmodifications based on this feedback and are now providing a recommendation for these time limits to start at 8:00 a. we\\nalso heard a number of considerations being brought forward from certain counselors whether this be the possibility of on Street paid parking a\\ntiter control on managing traffic in and out of Deep Cove consideration of reintroducing a shuttle service where\\ntechnology could be considered maximizing RPO spaces and reducing time restrictions down from 3 hours to two\\nhours all of these elements that we heard from the workshop have been provided by staff in the report either\\nthrough commentary or through the options that are provided for you we also know that some members of council\\nhave expressed inquiries relating to some type of parking exemptions for Deep Cove business employees and staff have\\nshared further information with Council on that matter in the interest of time I'll wrap\\nup here but I have staff available for any questions that we have for Council thank you just before you U leave the\\ntable we'll just double check so there were a number of questions that came in in the public input period specifically around the issuance of passes how many\\nper household is it consistent across um the uh the community and is there a\\ncharge for that first one or additional um passes being issued to a house sure\\nso the answer to that question is that we're taking a holistic approach across deep C where passes would be provided as two\\nparking passes for a household with a flex pass for visitors to be used as well uh the cost of that service uh or\\nthe fee for that would be roughly $35 um and that's in line with our fee for service perspective that we provide\\nto any fee that we have for these types of passes $35 per year as a nominal\\nrecovery fee for our staff time is that correct that is correct M little uh this is all to uh recover administrative\\ncosts for these types of passes thank you very much okay I'm going to give you a chance to\\nspeak in just a moment uh but you're not the first speaker on the list so I'm just going to check with uh uh councelor\\nma do you have a motion on the matter yes uh first Peter thank you for\\nthe report and thank you to your staff for taking the time to S you're moving\\nthe staff recommendation is that correct well I want to actually propose\\namendment is this the time or uh since you're the mover you can\\nmove it with whatever wording you want to okay I'm going to move it I'll decide if\\nit's in order if it Alters the motion but but you can you can propose it with an amendment it without an amendment you\\nit's just the motion right I want to uh move it with an amendment sure okay so this\\nwas um I apologize I I thought the uh clerk had a copy of this um this is an\\namendment for staff to further invest instigate not withstanding the report the information we got earlier today but\\nthat the staff be directed to further investigate the options feasibility and approach for exempting employees of Deep\\nCove businesses to certain parking restrictions before March 31st 2025 so\\nit's going ahead but staff would have time to look at these issues a little deeper uh so that staff may provide\\nrecommendations based on current on-site observations and feedback following the implementation of the new parking\\nmanagement Tools in Deep Cove ahead of the 25 2025 peak season moving the staff\\nrecommendation with the inclusion of exploring uh Workforce parking space\\nProvisions yes I'll second seconded by councelor m okay councelor M on the on\\nthe motion right you know um I think staff\\nhave a very challenging situation um as Peter mentioned you know the\\nreport's good but it may not be perfect because there's a lot of issues that are still unaddressed in the community\\num at this point I'm willing to take a bit of leap of faith because the staff\\nreport covers a lot of issues but I hope after a year we would um revisit some of\\nthe things that may be still outstanding and one of the things that potentially is an issue isue is whether businesses\\nin in Deep Cove will have enough um parking for their staff because if they\\ndon't that's going to potentially become an issue for them to get staff and run\\ntheir businesses so um I'm generally\\nsupportive that this was a a best attempt at addressing the three different uh groups user groups the\\nbusinesses the visitors and the residents okay thank you very much Council M your\\ncomments is it $35 per pass Mr\\nCohen yes so through the mayor it's $35 overall for the application do all\\nResident parking only areas in the district\\npay through the mayor yes upper Lin pay I'll take that away and we can\\nconfirm and there's I'd like to know the the um the number of passes that different areas get versus The Cove um\\nthat should come back so I will um support um councelor Moss but I'd like I have a number of amendments as well that\\nI'd like to add okay um so my Amendment to the\\namendment uh would be that we include rurn Parkside Lane Lock Haven and\\ncliffmont with with a variety of seasonal RPO and Resident exempt time\\npermitted parking okay is there a seconder for that amendment seconded by councelor Ma okay so discussion on the\\namendment councelor we'll we'll have if you you have it written down yeah we'd like to\\nprovide that to um and um\\ni' sorry oh and I'd also like to have um\\nthe extension of Cove Cliff go to the top of Strath Kona with the same variety\\nis Staff listening or\\nokay I've just got two areas and the four areas that were brought up um by Mr\\nFloyd in the workshop are the same streets that I'm talking about so I'm\\njust looking at Lock Haven Rayburn Parkside Lane and cliffmont to have the\\nsame variety as the other areas around the core and I'd like kof Cliff to go to the\\ntop of Strath clona and include Roxbury Place because that's the\\ncircle okay and soor this is a second amendment or that or you're just repeating what was in the amendment that\\ncouncelor Ma support So counselor ma is wanting uh the review for um employee\\nPark working I agree with motion that was actually that's already in the original motion yes so this is the\\namendment to that motion okay and and but the streets that you just listed those are the ones that you initially\\nlisted as the amendment therefore they were seconded by councelor m is that correct yesk you very rurn Park Side\\nLane Lock Haven cliffmont and then the kof cliff goes to the top of stth kona and then that the review take place in\\nthe fall of 2024 as an initial review so we can\\nunderstand what happened this summer and not wait until next fall but I'm fine\\nwith the employee issue waiting till next fall or maybe we can bring that forward earlier and then the final one would be\\nto address um 2151 Banbury it's a multif family complex it\\nwas the first one that was built in Deep Cove they have no visitor parking zero\\nand they would like um resident exemption okay so just to be clear\\ncouncelor M are you considering this all you're supporting all of this including the last one that was mentioned or would\\nyou like me to break them out as separate amendments I'm I'm trying to get them down to but generally up supportive if\\nthere was a bunch of issues that I bunch of concerns I had with the original plan but I was\\nprepared to let it play out for a year but if councelor Murray's bringing them\\nup now I'm supportive I just didn't to be honest I didn't want to go Street by street I'll consider them all as one\\nAmendment then ccor mury and my last one my this my last one take could just\\nbreathe just through it's I know I'm driving you crazy but just um and then my last one would be to um split more\\nevenly um Cliffwood Lane um there was a speaker that has been um speaking on a regular basis um\\nSonia who lives in that community and um uh the split of 8020 needs to be more\\nbalanced it's a very small area with a very steep um uh\\nincline again I'm checking with councelor ma is that all one\\nAmendment I'll keep it simple yes thank you them that all as one Amendment okay\\non the amendment councelor Mir uh thank you um so I recognize that um\\nMy Wish of putting resident parking only um throughout the entire uh area north\\nof Mount semour parkway at Deep Cove Road into Deep Cove is a big huge ask\\nand I I I completely support um the impact of the businesses um coming from\\na small business family and one um who worked on Gallant for over 10 years um\\nso um and I understand that taking away resident parking later is going to be a\\nchallenge so I I will agree for this gradual implementation but I think\\nwhat's missing is the understanding of how this community operates and the\\ngeography of it this community was built in the 1930s and for earlier than that\\nin the 40s and 50s where there were no permits for houses they were little Cottages that existed no one cared about\\nlittle Deep Cove build a house wherever you want half the people on Panorama put driveways on our roads that's why we\\nhave licenses to occupy for garages because they didn't build them on their own properties they built them on a road\\num the Steep incline of some of these areas the access points the access points in and out of\\nan area um doing u-turns in the middle of the road you need to I looked on the\\nmap um last week when we got the report and I noticed that the intersections of\\nsome of these areas there were little white areas um suggesting that that's where you don't park but if you go down\\nthere on a weekend there are people parked on the corners of the\\nintersection um I'll take my other two minutes actually on an amendment you don't get another two minutes isn't that\\ncorrect that's correct okay so so you could wrap up on I implore that these\\nair these additional amendments that I've added um are going to make it more\\nof a middle ground for people um it is going to be um more reasonably accepted\\nby the community and I think it's going to go farther to address the issue when we do get back to the main motion you\\nwill have an additional you will you absolutely will councel ma your comments on the amendment\\nplease just say what she said\\nthere are there's a lot of good work here and the staff have taken a lot of time what\\nI find with the Amendments they probably fine-tuned some issues that were brought up so I appreciate councilor Murray for\\nbringing that and I appreciate her supporting the uh my motion that I made\\nregarding the uh employees so that's it thank you okay um um I'll speak on the\\namendment um I'm having difficulty with this I think that the staff have done a\\nlot of work to identify an incremental step uh towards it I never saw it as a a\\nfinal um uh parking plan entirely but it would be very hard to fully Implement\\nRPO and then bring it back tailor it back there's no question the community would respond extremely negatively to\\nthat and so it's about moving uh creating additional RPO space but also\\nrecognizing all of the other uses that are that are in the space um particularly making sure that businesses\\ncan be properly supported uh with um um adequate turnover of parking spaces in\\nin the neighborhood um I I you know one place I would go beyond the staff\\nrecommendation was um I thought Park signed lanen should have been identified as fully RPO uh there is no safe\\nturnaround on Parkside Lane you have to turn around on people's private property up into their driveways whereas largely\\nthe other streets at least have a bulb or a place that you can turn around in in some way um and so I thought that\\nthat should have been there above and beyond the staff recommendation but um I'm I'm going to be supportive of the uh\\nrecommendation that councelor Ma put on the floor as a motion but I will not be\\nsupportive of the amendment um I think it goes too far I think it um it it\\ngives um uh private private exclusive use of public\\nproperty without Fair compensation to the municipality and the public as a whole uh but it also uh calls into\\nquestion whether we're going to be supporting our businesses adequately uh they they make no money in the off\\nseason so many of those businesses uh struggle every single winter and for us\\nto come down and clamp down on on the One season that they actually make money\\non I think that that's um that's not fair to them um and we'll will lose\\nbusinesses in the space so um I'm I'm not supportive of the amendment um and\\nwill be supporting Council M's original motion counc\\nback thank you Mary little um thanks everyone for your comments so far thank you staff for all of the work that's\\ngone into getting us to this point just three times that we've looked at this recently but going back many many years\\num and I think we all agree that we want to provide some relief to um residents in Deep Cove and try to make uh\\neverything work better down there and at those those peak times of the year um\\nbut I do agree with the mayor's comments um I I'm not supportive of going beyond\\nwhat staff are presenting here in in this recommendation um I would like to\\nsee us look at this uh um after this season so that um in a shorter period of\\ntime we we can get a sense of whether or not this is um having the effect that we hope it would have and we can um\\nincrementally um add more areas for RPO Etc um but I I don't want to go any\\nfurther than this uh right now um I too am supportive of of assisting um you or\\nbeing aware of of the challenges of the businesses and the staff uh in that area so I I do support that part of the\\nmotion um as well um just wanted to address a couple of other\\nthings um in terms of the issue of the Ann the cost of the annual parking passes I think $35 a year is is quite\\nreasonable if you look at RPO in in other communities like the city of Vancouver for example where I think it's\\nquite a bit more than that um I would like to see shuttle service explored\\nagain I know the report indicates that you know this is something that's been tried and it was unsuccessful um I still\\nthink if it's properly done um people will look to um use a service like a\\nshuttle service to to get down to the Cove um but those are sort of my comments uh right now I I'm supportive\\nof the motion but not the amendment okay thank you very much at this moment I see no further speakers on\\nthe amendment to call the question on the amendment all those in favor of the\\namendment all those opposed motion is is\\ndefeated um well it's because it's a tie well I I I have to count you in favor if\\nyou didn't vote against it um there's no yes councelor Forbes I am I didn't see\\nyour hand you were in favor okay so it ties to defeat three to three and so the amendment is defeated we're back onto\\nthe original main motion uh do we have a were was there a speakers list underway for the original\\nmotion okay thank you councelor muy on the main motion please and I believe you\\nhave spoken once on the main motion so this is your additional two minute on the main\\nmotion only on the amendment okay there you\\ngo um well I'm really disappointed that we couldn't simply expand we have\\nhundreds and hundreds we have thousands of cars coming into the the area we have\\nhundreds of parking spots that are turning over every three to four hours\\nfor people to go and support the businesses um we have lines of cars driving through\\nthe Cove we are constantly saying please find alternatives to driving your car\\nplease take the bus please walk please ride a bike except when you come to Deep\\nCove don't worry we're going to have some parking spots for you because we do not want to return livability to an area\\nthat has been under siege for years okay when when you go down into the Cove\\non a weekend um and see people parking in people's driveways um where they are parking\\nillegally everywhere where they are driving around the block dozens of times\\nto try to find the coveted parking spot that is a couple of blocks away from the park that is not environmentally\\nsustainable living that is not respons responsible living for the res residents and the businesses in the community\\nbecause it is impacting them as well they can't be any busier um when you\\nhave impacts to the surrounding Trail Network where new access points are\\npopping up on every street climbing that mountain that is not what our sustainable vision is for\\nour community um this has been a problem for uh years this has been a problem since\\nInstagram was invented and Air France did a commercial on quy Rock um the\\ncongestion in the Cove is unlike uh so many areas in the region and the region\\nis actually trying to address it bunson Lake for instance has put a reservation system in and it actually solved the\\nproblem um Port Moody and anmore no longer had to close a road because of the throngs of people coming into an\\narea um the West End as I brought up before in the past has resident only parking with pockets of public parking\\nfor um people that are visiting but you do not drive into the West End thinking you're going to be able to park on a\\nstreet um Horseshoe Bay for decades has had resident only parking throughout the\\nentire area except in the core where they've got their parking lots which is comparative comparable to the parking\\nlots that we have with sea SE Cove and Cove Cliff Elementary and our own um uh\\nour own municipal our own Municipal Lots this is not just\\nabout Resident only parking so residents can park on the street and visitors\\ncan't this is about managing congestion of cars that don't stop coming into the\\narea on the long weekends to the point where um a few weeks ago on the Eastern long weekend there was um so much\\ncongestion um and you know road rage is a regular occurrent down there um we had\\na flagger hit by a car actually run over and drag through the parking lot in Panorama parking lot um today I heard\\nfrom somebody that was at the Costco in Langley that said there was so much um there was a a fight that broke out in\\nthe parking lot and the police were called because people were fighting over parking spots like I I'm not sure what\\nwe've we've become as a society um when we're dealing with this kind of chaos um\\nI had a resident in Deep Cove um argue with a visitor who said why can't I park\\nat the bottom of eastly Lane why can't I park in your driveway and they said well you can't\\nbecause we park in our driveway but this res this visitor actually wanted to come in and park in their driveway simply\\nbecause it was empty and he couldn't find a spot I don't know why it's so challenging for us to um I'll take my\\nother two minutes I don't understand why we can't find a better balance between\\num our residents our taxpayers our businesses and our visitors it's like we\\nopen the door and say everybody can come at the same time on Saturday at 2: in the afternoon and guess what they do\\nthey all come at the same time we are not wanting to impact the businesses in\\nfact the the um the age-old story in the Cove is that um if there was a little\\nbit more breathing room all the locals would come back and support the businesses but right now the locals\\ndon't go to The Cove because it's so chaotic we want to support those businesses too I fought for those\\nbusinesses I was one of those businesses in the Cove um so I I'm very\\ndisappointed that there's not more support in tweaking um staff's plan um this is not\\ngoing this is going to do very little to reduce the circulation um issues that we\\nhave in the Cove um I did hear some counselors um at the workshop say let's just deal with this let's get get going\\num I'm glad counselor mom I'm totally supportive of of looking at um employee exemptions because I know it's\\nchallenging um but I'm really disappointed that with adding a few roads like Lock Haven is and Lock Haven\\ncliffmont and uh Rayburn Rayburn is right next door to kof Cliff Elementary\\nit's right on the back gravel field of kof Cliff Elementary like why do we not\\nwant to put uh some restricted parking in there when there's an entire lot for\\npeople to pull into it's not unreasonable Parkside Lane is a little tiny skinny Lane with ditches on both\\nsides you know with a dead end that winds up in a driveway like I don't understand why\\nit's unreasonable to include those roads um yeah I'm really disappointed I'm I'm\\nI've been fighting this fight for you know 20 years and I guess I'm going to continue fighting it and um and the\\nresidents are going to keep fighting it Council doesn't want to try to find just a little bit of a tweaked balance and I\\ncertainly didn't come into this chamber tonight thinking that I was going to get RPO everywhere I'm fine trying to create\\na balance but I'm disappointed that Council couldn't just add a few more roads with a mixture of seasonal RPO and\\ntime limited exempt councelor M thank you very much okay um on the main motion\\nuh any additional comments councelor ma second time speaking Yeah\\nthank you I don't have the history that uh\\nCouncil Murray has in that area I have tried to listen to some members of the community to learn about\\nit I saw earlier on the staff drawings about three concentric circles about you\\nknow the three different groups you had the residents you had the businesses and you had the\\nvisitors I would argue and hopefully this you know I'll be more\\nuh VOC about this um at the appropriate time when it comes back on the review\\nbut I think we need to give priority to the residents followed closely by\\nbusinesses the challenge is businesses are successful by both the residents and\\nvisitors so I understand the challenge the staff have but if we had to put them in order my first order is the residence\\nthis a comment um a second point and and I had a discussion with Peter but I I\\nthink it might be uh Mr milburn's group more but I think enforcement is going to\\nbe important and critical to whatever we Implement there and you know we talk\\nabout budgets we talk about being responsible but we also talk about our community we may have to look at whether\\nwe need uh you know I don't know the hours that are bylaw officers there I\\ndon't want to get at that level in terms of making those kind of decisions but I think it's it's important that we look\\nat enforcement if we're going to have rules there and these rules are going to have this impact that we want then we\\nbetter make sure that those rules are enforced okay thank you thank you\\ncouncelor m councelor Pope thank you very much\\num well I too am deeply concerned about residents in Deep Cove and the kind of\\nchaos that's been brought into their lives um and I I'm just not sure there's\\na perfect solution um I I do appreciate that staff have you know tried to\\nnavigate this and and come back with with a couple of different options um I\\nactually favor option two that endorses um uh pay parking on all the\\nstreets I think that we've seen that that works in other jurisdictions and um it would certainly\\nsend a strong message that people can't um park for free uh all day um and it\\nwould enable more people to to come and better traffic flow uh I'd also like to see still like\\nto see uh a shuttle of some kind on the weekend or in peak hours during s during\\nthe summer season I think it's it has been tried in the past but it wasn't as\\nbad as it is now um and so I think that's worth a second look um I do also\\nbelieve that we need enforcement to be really like really Hefty findes for\\npeople parking in people's driveways or longer than they're supposed to on the\\nstreet or where they're not supposed to um and uh I think we need to probably\\nhire more people to ensure that that happens or summer students or some\\nsomething um and we need to do it this summer uh and not wait until next year\\nwhich raises another point I'd like to see reporting come back um uh this year\\nnot wait until a whole other summer goes by and then have more I'd like to see some kind of fome report in the this\\nfall uh in addition to I knowe that there will be the tweaking done uh as we\\ngo um this year so that's good and I also support parking looking at parking\\nexemptions for staff um I think that's something we have to be cognizant of\\num those are my thoughts so I'm not quite sure where that leaves me with the options but I think but I think it it's\\noption two because option two includes the pay parking on the street I got that\\nright your Joyce additional comments yeah just some comments your worship um\\none of our goals first of all we've made changes to the Cove every single year we make changes every single year whether\\nit's overflow parking or changes around thepo um trying to keep up with that and one of the purpos with the workshops was\\nto show you the toolkit we had but the engineers are running out a bit of the toolkit so it's it's down to a community\\npolitical decision on this front the only thing to keep in mind is we again because of the chaos I acknowledge that\\nis to get something done for this summer which I start for me is May long weekend and that's on us now and you heard Mr\\ncooh say a couple of weeks ago after the workshop we can we can do that um this is a four-fold increase into RPO so to\\ncouncelor Ma's point we are absolutely uh you know prioritizing the residence or the Cove on the parking and\\nthe safety issues to council M's Point yeah there could be tweaking um this is our our best shot at it at this point in\\ntime but if there's safety issues that come up with culde saacs or Lanes or whatever we can look that as well but\\nI'd encourage Council to go with this and get something done this summer um so that we can so we can continue to\\nimprove in a battle that we continue to struggle with with residents coming to the C for visitors the shuttle bus uh\\nthat last time we tried was on a uh a loop um with uh the suspension bridge\\nand um gr Mountain I think this time and staff are looking at it we'd look at a staging area just over the second narrow\\nspecifically for the Cove I think is the only way that's going to work you'd have to have a staged area where hopefully we\\ncan find a location maybe cap University or something along those lines and then have that buzzle direct into the Cove\\nand then back as opposed to doing the the three the three-point route which really there was no take up on so uh\\nwhat came out of the study we did seven or eight years ago with two big things was pay parking which is coming your way as you know in the Parks and the shuttle\\nbus so those are those are in play but I would encourage council tonight to to give direction to staff so we can get\\nsomething in place for the residents this summer thank you Y and there is a motion\\non the floor that I think gives Direction on the bulk of of this issue so um councelor Pope you still had time\\nif you wanted to add further comments or you're complete thank you very much councelor\\nback your comments thank you very much uh I just wanted to reiterate my support for the motion on the floor because I do\\nwant to see some action taken for this summer season um and as Mr Joyce has\\npointed out this does represent a large increase in in RPO um with the ability\\nto to tweak it and I look forward to seeing the results of of how um this initial plan works uh when we when we\\ntake a look at it after this summer season um I would love to again take\\nanother look at the shuttle service and how we can make that more effective and see more uptake on it\\num I would also um sorry wanted to talk about Cory Rock\\nobviously uh when you talk about Instagram Cory rock is where people want to go in the summer um and I don't know\\nif that we've ever looked at any kind of a pass reservation system for that uh much like has been done um the Seymour\\nMount Seymour Provincial Park for instance um but I think maybe that's something that we want may want to explore as well when that's that's where\\nso much of the uh of the summer traffic wants to go and and do that hike that everybody's seen uh on social media um\\nand then you know I I'll feel more comfortable um making parking more restrictive when we have Transportation\\nInvestments that are actually complete and right now there is still no safe way to uh ride to Deep Cove um that's uh ex\\nyou know for all ages and abilities um I know you know we have we are making sign significant investments in Spirit Trail\\nbut it's going to be a few years 2027 uh being the target for having that link to deep Gove so um you know that's when\\nI'll feel comfortable saying that you know we're providing alternatives for people but to driving um but right now\\num those alternatives are not are not fully there so I think as a starting point um you know this is a plan that's\\ntaken into account a lot of different needs and I'm comfortable with it as I say with the ability to tweak it as we\\ngo along um my comments on the on the\\nmotion um I don't know how comfortable I am with issuing staff parking passes uh I\\nknow that I would definitely benefit from it meaning I've got two kids that work in the c um but I still think that\\nit probably violates to some degree our um our legal restriction on providing\\ndirect assistance to businesses um and because you would you would be making it so that they would have an advantage and\\nfree parking for their workers which is seems like a direct benefit to them\\nwhich I think would violate the provincial regulations that we have on it so um I would be curious if staff are\\ngoing to look into the matter if they could um perhaps give us some direction on on that legality piece um uh I I do\\nthink that the businesses are under a tremendous amount of pressure and they have a hard time hiring uh because uh\\nthe um the 211 and the 212 go to such limited runs um after certain hours\\nalthough most of the businesses are operating within their service hours U but um we do need to badly increase the\\nuh the weekend access on both the 211 and the 212 directly into the cope um they're not adequate service on the\\nweekends uh for the numbers of people that are going into there um but for the businesses itself I I I'll be curious\\nwhat staff come up with in their presentation um and look at you know what they would contemplate for that but\\num it's not something we offer anywhere else even in other very congested business spaces in other congested\\nbusiness spaces like klano suspension bridge the gr Mountain we expect them to\\nprovide opportunities for their staff either providing them Transit passes or\\nuh pay parking or uh it becomes a taxable benefit if they actually offer them parking within their space um and\\nso I think that um you know I I on the on the face of it I don't I don't know\\nthat that's uh lawful for us to do it but I I will look forward to staff reporting on it\\num on the general parking restrictions I I do think this is an incremental process we will try it out we've tried\\nout different things in the past we've made progress some things have worked some things haven't worked um and we'll\\njust keep moving towards that this is not an insignificant change quadrupling the amount of RPO is a very substantive\\nchange within the community um and definitely goes to the benefit of the residents so anything it says it's it's\\nnot um significant it is extremely significant um I get that there are still some uh streets uh and I will talk\\nto staff directly about the issues on Parkside Lane I don't think it should have I I it may not be appropriate for\\nany parking necessarily as well um uh not simply who owns the car uh it's an\\nextremely challenging Street to get in and out of without having to go onto people's private property to be able to\\nto do it um and so uh we should be looking at that separately uh but as far\\nas I'm concerned this is a step in the right direction it balances off the different priorities that we gave staff\\nand directed them to report back on so I'll be supportive of the motion as U\\npresented Council Forbes additional comments um yes um do I understand\\ncorrectly that what if we Implement what staff is presenting tonight is it coming\\nare we going to review it again in the fall uh it will be a combination of\\nthings it would be implementing the changes at the earliest opportunity it\\ncan be but then also reporting back on how the implementation measures are working can I get a clarification from\\nstaff MR2 Mr Joyce e worship you know as part of the plan every week through the\\nsummer we actually report out through the Rangers about how the Cove was behaving and so you'll get an update\\ninstantly with with what's happening in the numbers and the volumes as as this goes through but we'll have a much\\nbetter picture as things settle in and I recognize it may take a full season before folks recognize it may be not\\nworth their while to drive all the way into the cold because of the limited area of public parking it's not going to\\nhappen instantly uh but it should over a period of time help with that um and\\nagain I'm going to go back to csor Ma's points this is really staff's attempt to to certain balance a little bit would\\ngive much more preference to the locals and the livability of the neighborhood but at the same providing some parking\\nfrom some visitors and for the businesses think you've heard from a number of members of council that they'd like the report back uh in the fall if\\npossible um uh waiting till the spring to make changes doesn't give the the community enough leadup time to prepare\\nfor changes so uh yeah I'm sure staff can provide some updated the fal some analytics for the summer months yeah I'd\\nlike to see a fall report myself and then we can because it's also sta it's not just Community getting use it's also\\nif tweaks further tweaks need to be made it gives staff time to make further tweaks maybe the tweaks that were\\nmentioned tonight maybe not um so I'd like to see that report back in the fall\\num I will say I agree with you mayor about the benefit of staff parking it\\nalmost contradicts itself that the businesses are trying to survive but if parking spaces are taken up by\\nstaff who is working not buying I'm not sure that that's an appropriate use of\\nparking spaces um maybe the shuttle has come up again maybe the businesses need\\nto um arrange a sh a shuttle that the businesses pay for that comes from the\\nparking lots to bring their staff the staff has to get to that parking lot by a certain time if they want to ride in\\nso I mean something like that where they're not actually taking up the spaces in the C because I think it it's\\nself-defeating to give away staff passes um so that's my comment on that I am I\\nam a bit disappointed about that we couldn't do more tweaking tonight um but\\nI do appreciate all the work staff did and I do appreciate that it's a big going to be a big change it will be a\\nbig change it's not small um so I'll look forward to the fall and see what\\nthe results are very much I see no further speakers on the matter prepared to call the question all in\\nfavor contrary minded motion carries unanimously okay\\nthank you very much uh Council um uh we're a little tight on our 10:30 uh if\\nit's okay with you I think we'll leave reports to another day um uh and so uh\\nAdjournment\\nhaving completed the business of the evening I'll accept adjournment thank you very much councelor mury uh we are\\nadjourned I did just want to say thank you very much to the staff for preparing the reports for our consideration thank you members of the public for\\nparticipating in our meeting everybody have a fantastic evening and week good night\\n\"}"
