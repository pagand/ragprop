: Laura Roddan, Manager of Planning Services
SUBJECT: Review of Rural Housing Solutions Final Report
ACTION/

RECOMMENDATION
THAT

 the Committee recommends to the Board that the report titled ""Review of Rural
Housing Solutions Final Report"" dated March 20, 2024, be entered into the minutes and
filed.

PURPOSE/SUMMARY
To present to the Board staff research on how to address housing concerns in rural
areas.

BACKGROUND
On January 25, 2023, the Board of the qathet Regional District passed the following
motion:
THAT the Board direct staff to report back regarding solutions to mitigate the
current shortage of housing in rural areas.

and
THAT this review consider best practices of other regional districts, which types of
housing have been most successful, over-arching legislation regarding affordable
housing and VCH regulations which may restrict multiple housing units from being
developed on single lots.

STRATEGIC PLAN

:
Social Supports: we focus on diversity of housing throughout our region, encouraging
density in municipal areas.

TYPE OF DECISION

Directive Decision
DISCUSSION/ANALYSIS
Staff present the report titled ""Review of Rural Housing Solutions Final Report,"" dated
March 20, 2024, to the Board for review.

The report is attached as Appendix A.

The purpose of this report is to present strategies and solutions the qathet Regional
District can use to address the current housing shortage in rural areas.

The report's
findings were informed by interviews, housing needs reports, strategies and action
plans, staff memos, websites, and other resources from regional districts across the
province.

Staff also researched provincial and federal legislation, regulations, and
publications to develop this report.

A key theme that emerged from staff's research is that the lack of water and sewer
servicing, basic services, and community amenities means that rural areas are not
appropriate for high-density or affordable housing developments.

As a result,
development is primarily directed towards development nodes, municipalities, and
urban centres where services are readily available and accessible.

Nevertheless,
regional districts are still looking at increasing density and expanding housing options
where possible, pursuing regional partnerships, and providing educational resources.

CONCLUSION
Staff present the report 'Review of Rural Housing Solutions Final Report' to be entered
into the minutes and filed.

The Board can use this report to guide future decisions
related to housing.

"(16.0, 36.0)","1.0 Introduction
The purpose of this report is to present strategies and solutions the qathet Regional District
(qRD) can use to mitigate the current shortage of housing in rural areas.

While there are
many actors in the housing system, this report focuses on the tools local governments can
use to influence the housing supply in their communities.

This report considers best
practices of other local governments, which types of housing have been most successful,
provincial legislation, and health regulations that affect development.

Section 2.0 of the report discusses housing need, both broadly and specific to the qRD.

Section 3.0 describes the different actors involved in providing housing.

Sections 4.0 and 5.0
delve into the tools and resources available to local government, and how other regional
districts are implementing these tools.

Finally, Section 6.0 summarizes the provincial
regulations and best practices that affect housing development in rural areas.","['housing', 'housing__homelessness']",,,qtt_reg_rgc_min__2024-04-03__01
"(16.0, 37.0)","2.0 Housing Need
Adequate housing is a fundamental human right recognized by national and international
law.

This right is enshrined in the National Housing Strategy Act of 2019, which recognizes
that the right to housing is a fundamental human right essential to the inherent dignity and
well-being of the person and to building sustainable and inclusive communities.

1

The right
to housing is also recognized in Article 25 of the United Nations' Universal Declaration of
Human Rights and Article 28 of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.

This section describes what constitutes adequate or acceptable housing, the range of
housing options needed to ensure everyone has access to acceptable housing, and the
qathet Regional District's housing need identified in the most recent housing needs report
prepared by Patricia Maloney Consulting.

"(16.0, 39.0)","2.1 Core Housing Need
Housing significantly affects individuals, communities, and the broader economy.3
Unacceptable or unaffordable housing negatively impacts our mental, physical and financial
well-being.

The Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC) uses three indicators or standards
to determine if housing is acceptable:
1.

Adequate - housing that does not require major repairs.

Major repairs include
defective plumbing or electrical wiring, or structural repairs to walls, floors or
ceilings.
2.Suitable - there are enough bedrooms for the size and make-up of resident
households.

Suitability is determined by the National Occupancy Standard, which
recommends a maximum of two people per bedroom, depending on age, sex, and
relationship status.

3.Affordable - housing costs less than 30% of a household's pre-tax income.

Housing is considered acceptable if it meets or exceeds all three standards.

CMHC considers a household to be in core housing need if it meets two criteria:
1.A household is below one or more of the adequacy, suitability and affordability
standards
2.The household would have to spend 30% or more of its pre-tax household income to
access local housing that meets all three standards.

Those that spend 50% or more of their pre-tax income on shelter are considered to be in
severe housing need.

"(16.0, 40.0)","2.2 Housing Continuum
The CMHC's Housing Continuum visualizes the forms and tenures of housing needed to
ensure everybody has access to affordable and adequate housing, regardless of household
size, age, ability, or socioeconomic status.
Figure 1: Housing Continuum
Source: Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation
The housing continuum includes:
?

Homelessness: describes the situation of an individual, family or community without
stable, safe, permanent, appropriate housing, or the immediate prospect, means
and ability of acquiring it.

It is often the result of systemic or societal barriers,
including a lack of affordable and appropriate housing, the individual/household's
financial, mental, cognitive, behavioural or physical challenges, and/or racism and
discrimination.

5
?
Emergency shelters: temporary, short-term accommodation for those experiencing
homelessness or at risk of becoming homeless.
?

Transitional housing: temporary, short-to-medium term accommodations meant to
bridge the gap between homelessness and permanent housing.

Often includes
support, structure or supervision.

Examples include addictions and mental health
facilities, women's shelters, and youth shelters.

6
?

Supportive housing: subsidized housing with voluntary support services for people
with high needs related to physical or mental health, disability, age, or substance
use.

Supportive housing is intended to assist those who are at risk of or experiencing

homelessness and people who require supports to live independently or maintain a
successful tenancy.
7, 8
?

Community housing: an umbrella term that typically refers to either housing that is
owned and operated by non-profit housing societies and housing co-operatives, or
housing owned by provincial, territorial, and municipal governments.

9
?

Affordable housing: housing that costs less than 30% of a household's before-tax
income.

Encompasses permanent or temporary housing provided by private, public
and non-profit sectors and all forms of tenure - rental, ownership, and co-operative.

10
?
Market housing: includes housing that is bought or rented in the private market.

Typically does not receive direct government subsidy.

Housing is not a 'one-size-fits-all' strategy.

Different individuals and households require
varying levels of financial and social supports to remain housed.

Except for homelessness, a
healthy housing system will have an adequate supply of each type of housing illustrated in
the housing continuum.

Figure 2: Housing Wheelhouse
Inadequate housing in one area of the
continuum puts strain on the rest of the
housing supply and associated services.

For
instance, an inadequate supply of long-term
supportive housing can create a backlog in
transitional housing, push people into market
housing that is unaffordable and lacks
appropriate supports, or force people into
homelessness.

Adapted from CMHC's housing continuum,
the City of Kelowna's housing wheelhouse
communicates that housing tenure and
status is not a linear journey, rather it is
dependent on a variety of factors such as age,

"(16.0, 41.0)","2.3 qathet Regional District Housing Needs Report Electoral Area
A, B, C and D
The qathet Regional District Housing Needs Report Electoral Area A, B, C and D analyzes
current and projected demographic and housing data to estimate the number of housing
units needed by 2028 for Electoral Areas A, B, C, and D.

According to federal Census data, the population of the study area in 2021 was 6,237, an
increase of 7.79% from 2016.

As in many other rural areas in BC, the population in Areas A-D is aging and contains a higher percentage of seniors.

The median age in the study area
ranges from 57.2 to 62.4, significantly higher than the provincial median of 41.6.

Housing in Areas A-D primarily consists of single-detached units, with a high percentage of
ownership versus rental.

The majority of the housing stock is composed of units with three
or more bedrooms.

In terms of core housing need and housing adequacy, the report finds:
?
Between 2016 and 2021, the number of households in the study area paying more
than 30% of their before-tax income on shelter increased from 13.3% to 16.4%.

Of
renter households, an average of 26% were in core housing need in 2021.
?

Overall, the need for major repairs increased between 2016 and 2021.
?

Suitability remained roughly the same between 2016 and 2021.

Area A - 4% of housing is not suitable
o
Area B - 3% of housing is not suitable
o
Area C - 5.4% of housing is not suitable

The report projects a population of 6,612, a 6.01% increase from 2021, and a housing gap of
338 housing units by 2028 in Electoral Areas A, B, C, and D. The breakdown by electoral area
and housing type is shown in Table 1 below.

Source: qathet Regional District 2023 Housing Needs Report, Table E-1

The Housing Needs Report includes ten recommendations to help the qathet Regional
District meet the projected housing need:
1.Support secondary suites in all residential areas - Secondary suites provide
important rental housing options for people in the electoral areas.

The Provincial
government has mandated that secondary suites be permitted in all residential areas
across BC.
2.Support accessory dwelling units in residential areas where Provincial septic and
water servicing standards can be met - Accessory dwelling units provide important
rental housing options for people in the electoral areas.

The Provincial government
has mandated that accessory dwelling units be permitted in all residential areas
across BC.

For rural properties without community sewer and water servicing,
accessory dwelling units are permitted on parcels larger than one hectare where
provincial septic and water servicing standards can be met.

3.Promote non-profit housing societies - Non-profit housing societies provide a critical
role in developing and managing affordable housing options due to their ability to
partner with BC Housing and access funding from senior levels of government.

Local
governments play an important role in promoting the efforts of non-profit housing
societies to deliver affordable housing projects.

Municipal areas are better suited to
affordable multi-unit housing developments due to the presence of sewer and water
supply systems, and proximity to transit, employment, good and services.

Page 17 of 53
qathet Regional District Review of Rural Housing Solutions Page 10 of 46 Page 13 of 49
4.Collaborate with BC Transit to improve rural transit service - Improvements in
transit will support the options for accessory dwelling units, shared housing and new
construction of housing in areas currently underserviced by transit.

It is
recommended that the qRD collaborate with BC Transit to improve rural transit
service to improve the liveability for seniors, youth and the work force.

5.Promote public information on available grants - It is recommended that the qRD
provide information on the qRD website regarding Homeowner Grants for home
modifications to allow aging in place and for building accessory dwelling units.

The
website could also include information for other grant programs and contact
information for BC Housing and CMHC.

6.Promote partnership with Happipad - Happipad is a Canadian federally incorporated
non-profit that has created an App and provides a service to facilitate home sharing
that is safe, affordable, and accessible to those who can benefit most.

It is
recommended that the qRD promote a partnership between a Non-Profit Housing
Provider and Happipad to support house sharing by linking landlords and tenants.

This recognizes that there are people who may have a suite to rent but want help
vetting tenants, assistance with lease preparation and understanding of the
legislation.

This also recognizes that housing may be available but is not being
advertised in a public manner.

7.Consider review of manufactured home park policies - Manufactured homes and
mobile home provide important affordable housing options for people in the
electoral areas.

It is recommended that the qRD review current manufactured home
park policies and consider supporting the expansion of existing
manufactured/mobile home parks where provincial septic and water servicing
standards can be met.

8.Develop a process to track rental housing - It is recommended that the Regional
District set up a voluntary online registry to track rental housing units in the electoral
areas.

Without building permit authority or business licensing authority, the qRD has
no way to track rental housing units in the electoral areas.

In addition, it is
recommended that the qRD work closely with BC Housing to track new construction
in the electoral areas.

9.Collaborate with City of Powell River to consider establishment of a regional housing
reserve fund - It is recommended that the qRD collaborate with the City of Powell
River and consider the establishment of a regional housing reserve fund to support
housing projects.

Regional Districts can borrow funds by going through the legislated
Page 18 of 53
qathet Regional District Review of Rural Housing Solutions Page 11 of 46 Page 14 of 49
process (Local Government Act, Part 5, S. 185(b), Part 6, S. 210(d), and Part 6).

Funds
could be used to support land acquisition and affordable housing development.

10.Complete updated housing needs assessment in 2028 -

The time frame for this
Housing Needs Report is five years.

The Provincial government has mandated that
housing heeds reports be completed every five years.","['healthy_built_environments__community_design/planning', 'housing', 'housing__homelessness', 'housing__permits', 'environmental_exposures__drinking_water', 'environmental_exposures__liquid_waste/_wastewater/sewage', 'healthy_built_environments__active_transportation']",,,qtt_reg_rgc_min__2024-04-03__01

"(16.0, 43.0)","3.1 Federal Government
While housing policy and regulation is largely the responsibility of the provinces, the federal
government has historically played a vital role in funding non-market housing.

Beginning in
the 1960s, the federal government funded a large number of affordable and cooperative
housing units through grants and low-interest financing.

Austerity measures in the 1990s
resulted in significant cuts to housing and other social programs.

For over twenty years, the federal government invested very little money in housing until it
released the National Housing Strategy in 2017.

The Strategy sets out a series of targets and
actions the federal government can take to achieve its vision that 'Canadians have housing
that meets their needs and they can afford.

Affordable housing is a cornerstone of
sustainable, inclusive communities and a Canadian economy where we can prosper and
thrive.

'

11
The Strategy strives to hit the following targets by 2027:
?
530,000 households removed from housing need.
?
385,000 community housing units protected and another 50,000 units created
through an expansion of community housing.
?

300,000 existing housing units repaired and renewed representing three times as
many units repaired and renewed under federal programs from 2005 to 2015.

Provincial governments are responsible for housing policies and programs under the
Canadian Constitution and play a key role in financing non-market housing.

Provinces also
delegate planning and development powers to local government, which significantly affects
the location, type, and amount of housing built.

On April 3, 2023, the Province of BC released its updated housing action plan, Homes for
People.

and works
with local governments, non-profit housing providers, and private developers to address
housing gaps across the province.

In the fall of 2023, the Province of BC made significant legislative and regulatory changes to
encourage the development of more housing.

The changes are summarized below:
?

Bill 35: Short-Term Rental Accommodations Act13 -

The intent of this act is to return
short-term rentals to the long-term housing market.

increase fines and strengthen
tools for local government.

and establish provincial rules and enforcement
mechanisms.

The Act introduces a principal residence requirement for short-term
rentals in municipalities of more than 10,000 people, meaning short-term rentals will
be limited to a host's principal residence, or a secondary suite or accessory dwelling
unit located on the same lot.

Additionally, the new legislation grants business licensing authority to regional
districts, and increases the maximum fines and tickets local governments can set.

The Province will also establish a short-term rental registry and create a Provincial
compliance and enforcement unit.

Regional district electoral areas are exempt from
the principal residence requirement but can request to opt-in.
?

Bill 44: Housing Statutes (Residential Development) Amendment Act, 202314 -Requires local governments to update zoning bylaws to allow either a minimum of
one secondary suite or detached accessory dwelling unit, a minimum of three to four
dwelling units, or a minimum of six dwelling units in selected areas near bus stops
with frequent transit service.

The legislation also prohibits public hearings for
rezoning applications that align with an official community plan (OCP) and mandates
that local governments plan for the projected 20-year housing need in their OCPs
and zoning bylaws.

?
Bill 46: Housing Statutes (Development Financing) Amendment Act, 202315 -Expands permitted development cost charges (DCCs) to include fire, police, waste
and recycling capital costs.

Bill 46 also introduces the Amenity Cost Charge (ACC)
which will replace negotiated community amenity contributions.

To charge for
amenities, local governments will have to adopt a bylaw that establishes an ACC
formula and identifies the amenities needed in the community.

Amenity costs can
no longer be borne solely by new development.

Further, ACCs can now be collected
outside of the re-zoning process.

Local governments can no longer use this policy
tool to secure affordable housing, though affordable housing developers are exempt
from paying ACCs.
?

Bill 47: Housing Statutes (Transit-Oriented Areas)

Amendment Act, 202316 -Establishes minimum density, size and dimensions and eliminates minimum off-street parking requirements for housing within 400 meters of a high-frequency
transit station.
?

Housing Supply Act17 - Introduced in November 2022, this Act sets housing targets
and compliance orders for specified municipalities.

This legislation does not apply to
regional districts.
?

Speculation and Vacancy Tax Regulation18 - expanded the speculation and vacancy
tax to include 13 additional municipalities.

The Province recently released guidelines on how to add and manage a secondary suite or
accessory dwelling unit, and created a three-year secondary suite incentive pilot program
that opens April 2024.

As of February 2024, only incorporated municipalities and regional
districts with necessary building bylaws, building permitting processes, and inspections
services will qualify when it opens.

The Province may consider adding regional districts who
do not have building bylaws in place in year two or three of the pilot program.

"(16.0, 45.0)","3.3 Local Government
Local governments are typically most aware of the housing need in their specific community
as a housing crisis is felt most acutely at the local level.

The tools available to local
government to address housing need fall into four main categories:
1.Incentives
2.Policy and Regulation
3.

Partnerships
4.Awareness and Advocacy.

Each of these categories is explored in more detail in Section 4.0.","['housing', 'housing__homelessness']",,,qtt_reg_rgc_min__2024-04-03__01
"(16.0, 46.0)","3.4 Non-Profit
Non-profit housing providers are responsible for the provision of non-market housing,
which encompasses emergency, supportive, community and affordable housing.

Non-profits typically receive support from all levels of government to provide non-market
housing.

At times, non-profit housing providers may manage a portfolio of mixed tenure
units to offset the cost of providing affordable housing and ensure operational
sustainability.","['housing', 'housing__homelessness']",,,qtt_reg_rgc_min__2024-04-03__01
"(16.0, 47.0)","3.5 Private Sector
Providing the majority of available housing units, the private sector is composed of
developers, builders, investors, landowners, speculators, and landlords.

Private sector
actors provide the vast majority of market housing.

The private sector typically develops
housing for profit.

Therefore, their ability to develop non-market housing is limited.

Nevertheless, local regulation can require the private sector contribute to the non-market
housing stock.

This is explored in more detail in the next section.",['housing'],,,qtt_reg_rgc_min__2024-04-03__01

qathet Regional District Review of Rural Housing Solutions Page 16 of 46 Page 19 of 49
4.Awareness and advocacy
A summary of the tools is included in Appendix I - Local Government Housing Toolbox.

To inform this section of the report, staff researched housing-related guides and reports,
housing needs reports, strategies and action plans, staff memos, websites, and other
resources from regional districts across the province.

Staff also corresponded via email and
Zoom with staff from the regional districts listed below to learn more about how they have
addressed housing need in rural areas:
?
Sunshine Coast Regional District
?
Comox Valley Regional District
?

Cowichan Valley Regional District
?
Regional District of Nanaimo
?

North Coast Regional District
?
Squamish-Lillooet Regional District
A key theme that emerged from staff research and consultation with other regional districts
is that the lack of water and sewer servicing, basic services, and community amenities
means that rural areas are not appropriate for high density or affordable housing
developments.

As a result, development is primarily directed towards development nodes,
municipalities, and urban centres where services are readily available and accessible.

Nevertheless, regional districts are still looking at increasing density and expanding housing
options where possible, pursuing regional partnerships, and providing educational
resources to the public.",['housing'],,,qtt_reg_rgc_min__2024-04-03__01
