Squamish and the musqueam on Whose unseated ancestral lands the District of North Vancouver is located we value the
opportunity to learn share and serve our community on these unseated
lands thank you very much councelor Hansen Council we have an agenda that's been circulated I'd like to make two
minor amendments to it one that we move forward the recognitions to the front end of the meeting so that we can uh do
our Design Awards at the very front end and then other request was that 86 moved be moved to the end so we can
accommodate a council that's a counselor that's going to be recusing themselves from the matter and so I'd put forward
the agenda with those two minor amendments to it thank you mooved by councelor muy second councelor back I
want to propose a consent agenda can I we'll uh I'll get to that when we get to eight and I'll I'll come to you when we
uh start reports at 8 but uh definitely uh we can propose that um
okay so having done that now then the first item up for discussion tonight is
Recognitions (Heritage and Design Excellence Awards)
our Design Awards and uh Heritage Awards so I'm going to move into the middle
space here just to get us started off and uh just give me a
moment all right well uh good evening and welcome to the district of North Vancouver's annual design excellence and
Community Heritage Awards uh tonight's event is about celebrating excellence and creativity in design it's also about
acknowledging the efforts of individuals and groups involved in promoting and conserving Our Heritage uh We've
reflected in the past year and are pleased to have cons uh to have identified several excellent projects that contribute to design and Heritage
in the district uh design and Heritage are very very important parts of our community uh first of all the Heritage
pieces will help tell a story about the history of the community how it developed and maybe a snapshot in time
but it also gives people a great sense of uh of identity for that space and so
we want to make sure that we're protecting the uh Heritage in our community to help tell those stories uh
design is also something we don't always think about but it's passively occurring around us sometimes where you see a
building and go yeah that's a that that's really neat how they've done that entrance way or those steps or the design on on the interior spaces to make
it more accessible or other things that the public passively benefits from so uh I'm very glad that we're taking this
opportunity to recognize both Heritage and design it's something that we we definitely uh enjoy uh so tonight to
begin uh the awards ceremony this evening I'm honored to have Chief Bill Williams from the Squamish Nation here
to offer a traditional welcome Chief Williams uh welcome and thank you very much for joining I'll turn it over to
you and if I may Chief Williams these microphones will pick you up nice for the people at home if uh if you want to
be closer to them then we can make sure that gets shared with the virtual
participants my ancestral name is given to me by my family recognized by the
community governs and other agencies of the government identify that as Chief I
one of 16 meditar Chiefs of the sage Nation I'd like to thank each and every one of you for being able to be here to

the district itself for the protocol that they're moving forward and doing it in a good and kind gentle
way I I normally sing a song it's normally done

husband lived that Pap for many many many decades and her husband passed away so she had a a really broken heart and
and as she uh one day she's traveling from her her house to her sister's house over in hot which they call calano today

alongside me is Isabelle Kim Community planner and staff liazon to the community Heritage advisory committee we
would like to welcome everyone here tonight to the 2003 design excellence in community Heritage Awards
so before we proceed with the ADP design Excellence award ceremony I'd like to First provide a brief background on the
panel and announce this year's nominees so the ADP is a technical
committee made up of experts in the field of architecture landscape architecture public art inclusivity and
accessibility engineering development construction ction and Public
Safety these panel members are volunteers all Northshore residents and appointed by
[Applause] Council the primary role of the panel is to provide independent advice to counsel
and staff on development applications through the lens of their professional experience and to evaluate these
projects against Urban Design objectives to ensure they align with the district plans and
policies in 1992 the panel established the annual design excellence awards
program to recognize design Excellence all completed projects within a calendar
year are eligible for an award whereby the panel evaluates the projects based on a rating
system to determine if any qualify for a design Excellence award or an award of
Merit at this point I would like to take a moment to give recognition to our panel members members for uh who sit on
the panel of this year we have rapael Santa Anna who is our chair and
professional architect Alexis shakon who's the co-chair and accessibility
representative we then have two additional professional Architects Stuart rothney and fares Shafi Josh
burnson and Emily Blair are the panels to Landscape Architects from the development industry we have John
Gilmore and the visual arts representative is Brian Newton and then finally we have Kusha K India who is a
professional engineer and Sergeant Kevin bracewell from the RCMP we are very lucky to have many
local professionals on the NorthShore who volunteer their time so we want to say a big thank
you so moving on to the nominees we have five this year all of which are unique
well thought out and important additions to our community so on the screen you see the first three nominees with the
names of developers Architects Landscapes and public Consultants respectively underneath each photo the
first three nominees are Sunny Hurst homes Ean Flo in linmore
apartment and the last two are Premier or sorry parksite on Premier and
eastwoods now although all the nominees made significant contributions to our community
after much deliberation this year the ADP decided to recognize only three Award of
merits while all five nominees were commendable projects none quite met the criteria of design Excellence set by the
panel I think we still need to celebrate the effort and quality of all of these projects but this really this result
really reflects the panel's commitment to upholding high standards of design excellence in our
community and with that it's my pleasure to now announce the first award of Merit for this
year first up an award of Merit goes to Evan Flo by developers Woodbridge and
City Mark along with Choi architecture and M2 landscape architecture for
encouraging Community interaction in open space this is the first phase of 150 unit Strat Town Home Project in the
Lionsgate Village the panel specifically congratulates the design team on a
well-designed aesthetically pleasing new open space like Courtyard that clearly provides opportunities for residents to
connect fostering social interactions and Community cohesion as evidenced by
seeing residents utilize the space upon their site visit so with your permission your
worship I would like to now invite the project team to come up to the front to receive their Awards and a photograph
right there
and the second Award of Merit is awarded to linmore apartment by pivoted daa
projects rosich Hempel architecture Jonathan Loi landscaping and Ballard
fine art for enhancing the public realm through Landscaping this is a six-story rental
building with 89 units in ly Creek Town Center the panel specifically congratulates the design team on the
vibrant choice in plants and trees and locations of Hardscape elements that
contribute to creating an inviting environment along the green spine and the unique design features of the storm
water which create a cohesive distinct identity and character that enhances the public realm and once again I would like
to invite the project team up to the stage if they are here pivoted darl was going to come

architecture for Habitat enhancement and restoration area this is a 39 town home development
in Maplewood Village Center the panel would specifically like to congratulate the design team on the protection of
existing ecological conditions through tree conservation and specific placement of buildings that reduce the impact of
the surrounding environment given Maplewood Creek bisects the northern region of the lot and the significant
restoration of the stream and repairing area that occurred both offsite and onsite and the enhancement of the
streams ecosystem by converting these areas to a more natural state once again I would like to invite
the project team upstage I believe acustics this

tonight you have all the members of council here in person uh welcome have a seat at one of the spots there and uh
when you're comfortable Walter you have three minutes to address the council okay thank you for inviting me
your honor and council members I been playing pickle ball for about 10
years at this point and always been involved in developing systems and things started pickle ball Northshore I
started pickleball BC um right now I'm working with the advocacy committee with the NorthShore
pickleball group I've heard from several places that if we bring something to the
table we'll get some recognition and that's what we plan to do in short order we've got a group
working on at the present time and I hope to Shepherd them into a decent
presentation of what we'd like to see in terms of a significant pickle ball Hub
on the North Shore thank you for your time thank you very much for your comments Walter NE the next speaker I
have is Esa meld followed by Al
Floyd Welcome when you're comfortable you have three minutes to address the council thank you very much I'm Esa par
M I'm the current president of the NorthShore pickleball club I'm here today on behalf of thousands of existing
and emerging pickleball players in North Vancouver in support of councelor Pope's
motion to plan for more pickleball courts as this motion motion suggests
pickle ball demand is growing exponentially at this rate our thousand paying members of the NorthShore pickle
ball Club are projected to become 5,000 in just six years and we're growing
younger too pickleball courts are really a unique multi-generational facility
that you can build for huge social benefit and relatively little money and
first I want to thank Council and the park staff uh for being leaders on the NorthShore with regards to pickle ball
since 2019 you've built 12 beautiful outdoor courts but very wisely your Park staff
are continuing that planning process for for more courts a preliminary report on
Sports courts was presented last week at the parts committee meeting and happily two locations for future courts have
been identified this motion however points to some other opportunities and and issues
for consideration excuse me firstly unlike tennis people like to play short games
and swap partners and that's why larger groups of Courts like the four at little Kates and the six at Myrtle Fraser Park
attract a lot of people and this motion suggests that for the cost of paint you
could probably increase the capacity at little Kates by 50% building additional courts eight
courts from scratch requires a footprint of only two to three tennis courts and my people say it might cost $500,000
give or take but eventually a 12 Court surface would fulfill everybody's
dreams secondly unlike tennis you can't just sprinkle courts into neighborhoods and which is why finding a site for a
larger Congregation of Courts is preferred and I will say that since pickleball BC uh contracted sound
Specialists this last year and released this planning and operation guide you can have full confidence that all future
courts will be very wisely uh located interesting fact we have 14 pickle ball
courts on in North Vancouver and 43 tennis courts I need to wrap up but I
want to let you know that when there are lineups for courts Club volunteers facilitate fair and Equitable access
with the permit time you generously provide us and happily Club volunteers also host a few times a week which helps
serve to distribute some of the demand to other times club play is where singles are welcome forgive me if I'm
impatient but I'm old and I won't win any foot races those kids who are coming to get my courts so please pursue more
courts that's all thank thank you very much for your presentation
right I will just say that we want to make sure that there isn't Applause and cheering or booing or any of that stuff
we want to make sure people can bring forward uh um their views here without intimidation uh but I do understand
there's a lot of passionate advocates in the sport here uh the next speaker I have is El Floyd followed by Angela
Jackson
members of council welcome when you're comfortable you have three minutes to address the hearing yep thank you for
the opportunity my name is Al Floyd uh my uh wife and I have lived at 4567
Rayburn Street for 56 years I'm here to speak about the uh deep Co parking item
on your agenda later um I attended your workshop in March and got the
opportunity thank thank you for uh to make a presentation however uh I was disappointed to see in
the report in front of you today there's no change relative to 4,500 block of
ringor Street uh all of the parking according to the
report in the Cove in the core area except for this block of Rayburn Street
uh will have some form of mostly RPO uh and figures two on page 97 of
your package today has a good diagram that shows there's little old rorn Street all weight with no uh
participation in any changes whatsoever uh when I spoke to the staff about this
when the original report came out they said the reason that uh Rayburn in this
block was excluded was because there's not many houses on the street there's deep gold park on the North side and the
house on the South Side uh that is true probably there are 12 houses in this
block but uh we have Parkside Lane which is a small street that fees into Rayburn
Street about three4 of the way down it's a lane very narrow there are 27 houses
on that street uh and they quite frequently uh use Rayburn Street in the
4500 block for their excess over for parking Trad people uh so it's uh not
quite fair to say that only the 12 houses on uh rbor Street in that block
use the parking now because all of the other streets every street in the core area of
Deep Cove uh right over practic Strath Kota does have RPO
recommended and and in that case and the way the signage is and the traffic flow in the cove all of the traffic or a
large part of it is directed to the 4500 block of RoR Street and the ironic part
of this is to make matters worse in the summertime when uh Cove Cliff school
parking lots are uh used for overflow parking the entrance to one of those
parking spot uh spaces is about a quarter of the way down RoR Street and
there's a big sign that says parking this way uh down rurn street now they're
referring to the Overflow but of course when the Overflow is normally fil filled
by 9 10 o'clock in the morning they decide we might as well carry on down Rayburn Street and maybe we'll find The
Parking Spot well they don't because it is uh typically don't because it's full
also by 9:00 uh and the strange thing about it is when they're going down river and
they're going east and all the parking spaces are on the North side facing west so if they do find a parking spot they
make a U-turn or turn around in somebody's driveway we're overtime Mr Floyd if you could draw to a close
please okay uh and the one I want to mention that u in the staff in their
report originally that was considered at the workshop one of their criteria was visitors will be encouraged to reduce
circuitous movements by using parking restrictions thank you very much for your your comments Mr Floyd uh
unfortunately we do have to stick to a schedule and and but thank you very much for your
comments this evening thank you okay the next speaker I have is Angela Jackson
followed by Emory uh ngi Angela Jackson may be joining us
virtually uh Angela can you hear me yeah I can hear you can you hear me I can
clearly welcome you have three minutes to address the council meeting perfect thank you well good evening mayor and Council um as mentioned my name is
Angela Jackson and my husband and I have been residents of burns Avenue in Deep Cove for 30 years we find ourselves
right now at the center of the new parking regulations proposed by staff to council tonight our CER saac is one of
the few residential streets with zero parking restrictions at present this Arrangement has worked pretty good for
us and Us and other residents on our street throughout our time here um and while our ceset can become very busy
during the summer months and there is an increasing number of vehicles calls from adjacent streets permanently parking
here we have managed to cope as a collective group of neighbors
our cesac applied for Resident parking only status about a year ago while we
were granted RPO initially we subsequently withdrew our request this
decision arose because the regulations would have replaced us in a significantly worse situation than our
current one it became evident to us that surrounding streets such as Banbury
calonia and Panorama which were also granted RPO status received multiple
parking permits per household along with additional visitor parking permits in
some cases consequently our cesac was surprised to discover that we would only
be granted one perking pal per sorry one parking permit per household requiring
that vehicle to be registered and Link to that specific residential
address and on top of that no visitor parking permits at all this realization
prompted our withdrawal from the process my question to District staff
and Council today is when these new regulations are approved will every
residential home within one zone be treated equally or will will there will there be
a situation of zoning within zoning due to certain grandfathering
scenarios I am sure that the current holders of RPO permits would object if
they were to lose their current multiple parking permit allocations furthermore residents yet to
be zoned will be very disappointed if they are not treated fairly and do not receive equal
consideration thank you very much for allowing me the time to address this issue with you thank you for your comments Angela
Jackson the next speaker I have is emry n followed by Sonia
suzak Em's joining us here in person welcome when you're comfortable you have three minutes to address the council
thank you first I want to thank the council for this opportunity to address our concerns my family and I live at
Rock Cliff Road for the last 14 years goes without saying we love the area and cannot see ourselves anywhere
else would like to express my obser ations regarding what we currently refer to as the zoo having to do with parking
and traffic concerns on rockcliff road mostly in the warm weather months increase during the weekends from
numerous conversations with my neighbors we all share the feeling the district has graciously set aside permitted
resident only parking for the residents of the street currently in effect from the period of March 01 to September 30th
most of the resident permit spots are located in front of their home homes in our case across the road from our home
at the top of rockliff we have five spots allocated for between three and four homes while this dat period was adequate
when we first moved into the area it is no longer so many weekends outside of that calendar period now have
significant visitors which on occasion means again we are left without any parking much more disturbing is the
aggressive interaction with visitors who surely after spending considerable time
trying to locate parking are often extremely agitated and frustrated and
decide to utilize permitted spots ourselves and our neighbors have routinely notified visitors they cannot
legally park there few are thankful and move however 30% of the time the
response is too bad that is where they will be staying and have no issue in paying whatever the parking fine is
which currently is $45 paid within seven days when informed we will be contact
acting parking control to try to have them towed an idle threat since bylaw refuses to tow responses vary however
being verbally attacked and or threatened laughed at and on one memorable interaction my vehicle was
keyed down the entire side after an hour some do however leave at that point
my rough estimation is that Peak periods between 100 vehicles per hour drive by repeatedly looking for parking and a few
end up taking any available spots in previous years it was common during the day to have four or five different
cycles of vehicles parking illegally in each stall bylaws generally would make one or two visits per day usually
between 10:00 a.m. and 3 p.m. meaning both vehicles do not even get a ticket I
must add we seem to be having more frequent visits from BW this year thank you for that Tuesday nights have also
become challenging the kayak Center holds races in the summer that start at 7 p.m. people though there are no
enforcement of parking regulations through the time and make use of any spots available including resident
areas in almost every other jurisdiction people Park in residential only areas
they're potentially towed we respectfully request the council provide direction to engineering and bylaws to
start enforcing parking regulations by Towing illegally parked Vehicles seems to be the only measure to have people
respect RPO spots side not I cannot understand why temporary signage leading
to Deep Cove keep displaying the message Deep Cove parking is full however overflow parking
available this gives drivers false hope and it's simply not accurate but 10 a.m on warm weekends all parking is full I
mean why why do we keep having that chair anyways thank you very much for the time and have a great day thank you
very much next speaker I have is Sonia susac followed by Shelley
wheel joining us virtually hi there can you hear me uh yes I can
welcome you have uh three minutes to address the council okay thank you very much for your time I'm Sonia
representing the residents Cliffwood Lane and Cliffwood Lo uh Road I too am
um uh to the agenda item 8.6 regarding the parking in Deep Cove um our streets
have some concerns with the future plans of what's being slated for the parking
on our streets uh for reasons that I discussed at the last meeting but in a
nutshell we're we're concerned about the continued circling of par cars the safety of the kids the property wear and
tear and obviously availability for the homeowners uh when the public come in
and take up all our spots um and now uh I'll turn specifically to Cliffwood Lane
I see on the map that they've slotted us for 80% timed and 20% that's what it
looks like anyways 80% for Time parking 20% RPO well I don't know how that's
going to service our our neighborhood because there's nine homes that utilize Cliffwood Lane and already there's maybe
12 spots so if 0 of that is timed and we
there's an event in the cove and we go out we come home and we cannot find a spot so I'm not sure if that can be
amended to 100% RPO or possibly reverse sit and have 80% RPO and a couple spots
visitors because we're already struggling and we have nothing so I'm not sure how that's going to work um and
I also uh wanted to just clarify uh my understanding is that each home will be given two decal assigned to their home
so I hope that still will be in play um given this situation but again I I can't
stress enough that we would prefer Cliffwood Lane and Cliffwood Road being 100% RPO just due to safety and the
circling and the congestion and yeah it it it's becoming a headache for us here
yeah and and Horseshoe Bay has gone completely uh paid parking or no parking
and the businesses function and they seem to make it work so I'm not sure why we can't do the
same for our our neighborhoods here thank you I think that's it okay
thank you thank you very much for your comments uh Sonia susak uh the next speaker I have is Shelley wheel followed
by Candace Quinn joining us in person welcome when you're comfortable you have three
minutes to address the council thank you may and Council for giving me time I'm here to talk about the motion regarding
pickle ball courts um aside from being a pickle ball Enthusiast I'm also a district taxpayer
and and so far and so am concerned about the cost of installing the courts but also the lack of land
available on Saturday at the beginning of April we were playing at Tempe and we had 16 players being playing pickle ball
in One tennis ball court eight were standing on the on the empty tennis court actually waiting to play so having
a large group of friends who play the game uh one night we after a couple bottles of wine we thought well maybe we
should find out if there's available space to play pickle ball or maybe it's just our imagination that there's courts
that are free so we started what was called a court Crusade and the objective was to find out if in Lind Valley
specifically there was more room to have some pickleball courts uh so we went and
we did it very I'm not going to say this is the way you should study usage but what we did is we decided we were going
to check who was playing on the courts at what time so we had randomly over about a 19-day period we went and
checked at different times of the day we checked tempy or I know isn't even ours
um but Karen magn and the Caren Magnus lacrosse box the Westover who who have a
beautiful practice wall as well and a parking lot uh The Institute pickle
bille courts and Underwood there's also the two located at princess Park and bremar which they were too far to drop
you so we didn't go there anyway so we checked those out um and over this time
we came we found that of there are nine tennis courts and essentially One tennis
court including Tempe that we can use to play pickle ball of the people we saw
playing there was 11 over that period of time there was 11 people playing tennis
there was 66 people playing pickle ball so on One tennis court so for we're
advocating for ly Valley to actually have more Court um we think this is an
underutilization of District assets do I understand that tennis doesn't want to
lose space I'm sure they don't because it's a great sport as well um but with
this kind of usage I'm not sure there's not Ral rationalization to if not hand it over to share it um totally
understand why more fome tracking wouldn't be necessary than what we did
um the noise issue I understand is always out there uh Karen Magnus though we live right by there that lacrosse box
is perfectly located to affect very few people and even the ones behind the church maybe you can't play Sunday
morning but there's some room there I believe um so we are hoping to see that
those areas uh looked into um Lind Valley is densifying uh quite a bit uh
we're at a highway kind of choke point uh in the area and we are a big tourist attraction area so what we have to do as
Lind Valley residents is to get out of our cars and be able to walk to our courts and this is why I'm hoping that
we can find some space in our in in the tennis courts that are available in L Valley to add some pickle ball space
overtime if you could draw close okay I'm done thank you so much for your comments [Music]
sh all right the next speaker I have is Candace Quinn followed by Phil
grai thank you mayor and Council for your time um I've joined this evening
just to for agenda item um regarding the Deep Co parking review um I can
completely acknowledge that a lot of time has been put into this project what I really appreciate I'm I'm a resident
of Deep Cove um on cliffmont road and and I'm fine with what I've seen
proposed in terms of the restrictions personally um in terms of zoning and restrictions however the part of the
document that I'm a bit concerned about on page 99 states that Resident parking permits um will be available for
purchase um I know a few of the other residents have already stated that um
households will potentially get free permits which was what I was actually going to propose um so ideally I would
like clarification on whether or not households will be getting um a certain
amount of permits per year and also visitor um parking passes um because
obviously we living in this area the the I think the proposed parking plan is to
help improve quality of life for residents in the area during the busy season um and having to actually pay for
parking permits for the privilege to park on our own roads uh um obviously would take away from that goal um so
yeah so if there is if it is going to be um a situation where we're having to buy
the permits to park on our own Road I'd like to propose that we do get an allotted amount of uh parking permits um
throughout the year for her household and in addition to have visitor passes
as well and that's everything so thank you for your time okay thank you very much
for your comments Candace Quinn and the last speaker in public input tonight is Phil
grai joining us here in person uh welcome when you're comfortable you have three minutes to address the council
meeting hello is that Gavin Joyce they see in the background no still still
hanging in there that boy gav's in my neighborhood uh my name is
uh Phil grassy resident of um 2465 Berkeley since
1989 I've been active in sports most of my life if not all my life been involved
to high levels of teams with hockey lacrosse baseball and pickle ball for over a
year what should be highlighted with pickle ball when mixed with other sports is the huge social aspect of the sport I
mean there is a a hockey there is definitely a a room and we have a lot of
fun and everything else but this is huge going into going to a pickle ball court the way we play it here with a community
you're not sitting in a room with 15 people you're you're in a room with it's I we've had 30 40 people and you get to
know everybody and and uh you get to um you play against each other you play
against uh with people and you share the the L it's it's it's a beautiful sport the
point I want to talk to about is the younger generation that are now growing the sport this group are commonly online
commun communicating and dating um they do not participate face
Toof face and I'm looking at this this sport is a perfect opportunity for a
generation that's it's that seems to be as is showing up
and the fact that they can come and um you rotate with participants it allows
for easy communication between new and regular players the face-to-face contact
that is missing from this generation is made very easy by the informalities of
this game the only barrier now is the is more
involvement I'm sorry the only barrier now to more involvement from a very
curious group of younger generation or more courts thank you thank you very much uh
Phil grassy and uh I was um I I actually do have one other person who signed up to speak before the meeting and so I do
have one more speaker here this is uh John Grant joining us here in
person welcome and when you're comfortable you have three minutes to address the
council had you set it up ahead of time on the okay you can try it so you plug just
below the lip of the desk on your side you'll see a USB slot and you should be able to fire it in
there and uh if it's an Apple product I can't help
you that much but um uh the PC products tend to work fairly well for the slid
shows and such
no that's
okay seems like it's come it looked like it was coming up but do they still have we have to shrink
the old slide presentation or there you go I do apologize this is
um this's a bit on left field in terms of parking and pickle ball and I appreciate I'm off
agenda it's a bit of a heavy topic too and I don't take it lightly but I'm here to talk about the uh proposed provincial
legislation on resoning uh in particular there we go in particular you know it shows that 42% of
the people in the district will be exempt from the possible rezoning um selfishly I you know I like I live in
the forest interface Zone I would like to be included in the resoning uh
because I'd like to use it to help my family Thrive here which is to say you know how common is the question we hear
in our community what are the children going to do for housing well this this uh proposed legislation May provide that
for us uh but I do see a greater opportunity for us as a community and that's that's what brought me here and I
recognize we're talking about fire here and I don't take I do not take that lightly believe me actually in fact two
of my family members died in a fire when I was quite young and uh yeah so I do
not take that lightly so believe me when I tell you I'm just saying hey let's change the fire Zone um what I like to
point out to you is that uh so we've been Exempted and I understand the purpose and I've read up on the purpose of the fire zone uh but I'd like to
point out to you that houses are part of the problem here in fire zones like if we look at Lon if we look at Paradise in
California we look at Colona or soyers etc etc but if you look at this house in uh La haa Hawaii the owner built it with
a metal roof concrete walls and and fire resistant landscaping and they didn't do it on purpose but it just turn it turned
out that it saved the house uh and and I think that as a result of all these tragedies uh fire resistant
housing has become much more of a reality so what I came here today to say to all of you was the idea that we put
on a blanket on the on the um fire interface Zone and say that if you're going to build there you have to build
with uh maximum fire resistant um thinking in mind you know take take my
house for example it's a vinyl clad house it has a shingle roof it's surrounded by Cedar hedges would it not
be better that we took the opportunity in this resoning to change it into something that was heavily fortified in
terms of fire resistance right the fire the fire you know in Heavens that we don't have that but should this happen
we can have houses as a defense in the fire zone as opposed to being something that will help it jump so I'm just I'm
proposing this idea to us that we have maximum fire um interface dens or sorry
um mitigation and I just like to propose this to you now because I know the timeline is June 30th and I just want to
be part of a process that's like Fair Equitable and um yeah inclusive thank
you uh thank you very much the item is not on tonight's agenda so I I'm not
going to go into a great deal detail on it um but I will just say just to clarify your first comment was that it
was proposed legislation from The Province to be clear they already gave Royal Ascent to the part that uh for 44
that we would we U um we have to comply with so the provincial side has already
been done we have to bring our zoning in compliance to match uh the provincial what I would imagine and Council hasn't
had a a full discussion about this but at this point we are putting in the exemptions for DPA Wildfire slope uh
flood um as hazards under 44 um but I imagine that uh we will have to address
uh coming up with I ways to meet the test if somebody can make a house out of
non-combustible material like we we release the DPA if somebody produces a
house with non-combustible materials um under our normal process uh likewise if
we can defense against floods sometimes we'll release the DPA on that if it's on a slope and we have an Geotech and
engineer address the slope hazards and so in the past our DPA and Hazard uh rules were done to sort of uh to help us
press for those improvements in the housing before they get approved now um
we have to decide how we're going to use the exemptions um going forward so uh out of the gate the legislation will be
based on on the current regulation but I do anticipate that we will have to have discussion in the medium term about how
to release places that can mitigate the risk in their in their space I think it's unreasonable not to have some
discussion about that in there so thank you very much for raising the matter for tonight's thank you for the response
thank you everybody
okay all right Council uh returning back to the order of the agenda um I do think
Reports from council or staff
that it's a good idea to prepare a consent agenda so that we can focus our time on the issues where um where uh
Council wants to have uh Fuller discussions um I I had an initial um consent agenda proposed by Council back
which was to consent items 8.1 8.2 and
8.5 so this is uh the development variants permit uh co- house for 1564
Lind Valley Road bylaw 8684 provincial electric Kick Scooter pilot Project
Extension and uh 8.5 grant funding application for Kates Park wayt in
Shoreline restoration since that time I did have a member of council wish to pull 85
but not hearing that okay so we'll put it forward for Council for those three
items 81 82 and 85 any of council if they wish can withdraw the items for consent for Fuller discussion as part of
the regular agenda hearing none okay so it's uh moved by councelor back you you
raised it so I'll take it as moved by councelor back second by councelor Pope prepared to call the question all in favor contrary minded motion carries so
if you came here to hear about 8.1 8.2 or 8.5 those items have just passed and
we'll focus the remainder of the time on the other uh items so the next item up
8.3 Bylaw 8689: 2024 Tax Rates Bylaw
for discussion is is item 8.3 this is the tax rates bylaw 8689
2024 and uh's staff get
prepared so Mr danelo and uh Mr eorio are online uh to answer questions Mr
danock do you have any opening comments on the matter thank you worship yes I do at the April 15th property tax
distribution Workshop after considering the district's tax rates are gener competitive within the region and
considering the issues within each of the property classes as well as the additional support being provided by by
The Province to business this year Council directed staff to prepare the 2024 tax rates bylaw based on even
distribution of the tax levy among the property classes staff will also be
preparing a report back on the property tax strategy later this
fall and St for available that answer any other questions Council may
have okay thank you very much I'll be moving the recommendation is there a second or on the
matter seconded by Council mury uh just my own comments we've obviously had lots of public discussions leading up to this
um uh process um obviously we're not eager to be passing along a 7% uh cost
to our community but that does reflect the increased costs that we've seen our construction costs have been coming back
way higher than that so that is a averaged out across our op operations um
and there's no way that we could um come down to a lower amount without
significantly uh reducing changing our operations in the organization um I I
will do everything I can to make sure that this is a one-time thing and that we return to the pattern that we had of
of low tax increases where we're I think for about a 14-year period uh we had we
were below 3% uh at or below 3% uh and then last year we had a slightly Higher
One and then this one at seven um so you have my commitment to do everything we can to to keep that down going forward
but there's no question that it reflects a higher cost of doing business as a municipality in our community um and if
uh if you saw some of the prices of the contracts are coming back you'd be uh very shocked um at what the cost of of
getting work done on the NorthShore has moved to um but uh at this time so I
will be supporting the rec recomendation after the whole process that we've been through uh which is that it is 7%
distributed across all classes evenly um I guess I should make a comment on that
at the workshop we did consider um uh potentially looking at relief for um
Light Industry specifically um and we did talk about earlier about relief for um for business
Community um there are other ways that we can um offer um relief and benefit to
to those kinds of organizations to our other policies uh but at this time because of their ability to write off a
lot of the costs for their Taxation and also because uh we're trying to make sure that we're not overburdening the
Residential Properties as well uh I think it's prudent for us to keep it equal across all classes uh this time uh
we have in the past done two shifts I believe to uh from commercial to residential uh but um uh we I don't see
that being a significant benefit even to the commercial classes a lot of people want to see us give relief to the small
businesses in our community and there's no question that um a lot of businesses are stressed but when you use this tool
as the way to do it you're overwhelmingly giving the benefit to uh large organizations the the McDonald's
and Starbucks and all of the other large organizations before you're actually giving it to the mom and pop uh stores
that we we definitely want toh keep uh because they keep our community interesting um and so we'll have to look
for other ways to to assist whether it's better use of the curb space uh to make sure they can turn over parking for
customer purposes or other mechanisms available to us but uh transferring off the class into residential is uh a
fairly blunt tool and doesn't help us uh Focus the benefit where the benefits needed uh plus the issue of the
restaurant um losses is something that we're seeing across the entire provin BC
uh so it is a larger economic problem that we're we're facing but um uh we do we have been putting resources into uh
neonilla loba's work to look at the environment uh for uh businesses in our
community to make sure that they're properly supported by the municipality whether that is with uh outdoor customer
service areas or other permitting processes that they need to go through and making sure that those are done in an efficient manner um so we're we're
going to try and help those businesses in other ways that are a little more um tailored um but um so at this point I'm
going to be supporting the recommendation which is uh that it be shared across all classes evenly at
7% uh Council M additional comments uh thank you mayor little I
voted against the 7% increase um during this year's budget um I felt that it was
too much uh considering uh the impact to the utility um the community is aware of
the um the uh uh increase to the sew treatment plant on the North Shore um
notwithstanding uh future projects within Metro um those projects were at once one time tens of millions or
hundreds of millions of dollars we're now talking billions and billions of
dollars we have a population of two and a half million people in this region growing by an extra million in in the
future um probably growing beyond that and uh this is what growth costs and uh
development has not pay been paying for growth Metro Vancouver has made that statement um they've been pushing hard
hard on the fact that the development Community has not been paying for the growth that we've been receiving we
already see the impact of growth we need more pickle ball courts uh we don't have enough parking in Deep Cove um we don't
have enough Trails for all the people that are living in Towers in other parts of the region that don't have backyards
like we do um that all costs money um this budget um part of it is to continue
them to maintain the implementation of our ocp which is based on growth
and uh I I think that we need to pull back I think that we need to start living within our means when you get
your utility bill this year um you'll you'll have a good discussion with yourself about what living within your
means is all about uh it's going to be something that you haven't seen before in fact your
utility bill in the future will surpass your taxes your your property taxes it
will surpass your taxes for land and land is some of the most expensive in
the province if not this country so um I think that Council really needs to have
a very good heart-to-heart about how we're going to move forward we're very um spoiled we're very fortunate on the
NorthShore we have a lot um all of the um additions the amenities that you see
with the new town centers lower Lyn ly Valley lower capalino all those new plazas and parks and all of the trails
and the facilities and the spines to ride your bikes on all of those me much of that has been given by the
development Community as part of density um they all become depreciating assets on our books and we are responsible to
replace them in the future so um just like your own home um you don't buy new
furniture when you have a roof a leak in your roof uh you wait and fix the roof first uh we have to do a better job and
through our asset management we're going to start working at um making sure that our assets are looked after there's been
a glut in our parks department over the years parks are working hard to um catch up to that blut that um we've deferred
over the years um but we have to look after the the bones of our municipality
first and um all the extras I think we have to really have a a heart-to-heart
discussion about whether or not we're going forward and how much we can all afford we have an aging population in
the district um we're we're land rich and many of us are cash poor and um I
think we have to really understand what's coming and part of that is the growth within the region
Transportation utilities um and the things that keep
the hold on hold on people can defer their taxes but you
cannot defer your utilities you must pay them yeah okay we're not going to have a
discussion here Council M if you can complete your comments that'd be appreciated thank you so you can defer your taxes thank you very much Madam for
um um bringing that up you can defer your property taxes but you cannot defer your utilities currently the provincial
legislation does not mean does not allow you to do that and uh with those utility bills that will surpass your property
taxes um it will be challenging for many many maybe not some but for many it will
be very challenging so um this is about spreading the taxes across classes it's
not necessarily about approving the increase that's already been done this is about how we spread it fairly over
the different taxes industrial Light industrial commercial residential as an example
thank you very much counselor councelor Hansen yeah thank you very much um I'm
going to just immediately jump in on the issue of the deferral just for clarification so everyone does
understand you cannot defer your utilities and one thing that everyone at
this table knows and many in the community now know is that the cost of utilities are going to be rising very
significantly uh this was uh brought uh out recently by councelor Pope uh with
respect to the cost of the NorthShore ww waterer treatment uh plant and other uh
utilities that's being well broadcast so we can expect utilities to arise
abruptly and we're not going to be able to defer those uh dealing just more
broadly with the issue of deferring taxes uh just because you're able to put your taxes uh put them on a debt doesn't
mean that everyone in the community wishes to face ever larger growth growing taxes and just treat them as a
form of debt so I like councel are very sensitive uh to the issue of tax rates
and we're not going to be wishing that issue Away by saying well you can defer it because you're going to have to pay
it eventually with compound interest uh not withstanding that I did vote in
favor of the 7% increase I view it to be a correct balance against the very challenging competing needs of Taxation
on the one hand and the needs of our community and making sure that our fiscal house is in order going forward
with respect to what we pay now what we pay in the future if uh we Short change
that increase in my view too much we're just putting it off to other people down the road who are going to have to pay
off the debts and so forth that are incurred uh for some of the uh infrastructure projects um I also
support even distribution in this case as against the uh classes uh
this was being debated in the workshop and I won't uh go over it again except to say that I do think in this
circumstance even distribution is appropriate um I look forward to the
review in the fall of uh the taxation on the major industrial classes I
understand there's going to be a broader review uh with respect to uh how the classes can contribute and uh how that
should be going forward I also look forward to the discussion with respect to how the Ral housing legislation which
has the potential to increase residential property assessments is going to affect our the need to ensure
fairness and balance in our taxation I'm going to use uh the little bit of time I have left to focus on an issue that I'm
uh particularly perturbed by which is the ports property uh tax act when I was
first elected in 2014 I was shocked to learn uh that the large some of the
large Industries and biggest potential polluters in our uh Community uh were
given a special deal by the provincial government whereby their taxes were capped and the rate of increase on those
taxes have been capped and that was in 2014 uh we're now um 10 nine 10 years
past that this issue continues to be flagged with the provincial government and nothing is being done about it the
effect of this is that every year uh residential class and light non-capped
heavy industry Light Industry business class you're all going to pay 7% more
there's only one set of taxpayers in the community that aren't going to pay more and that's the Capp heavy Industries the
largest uh industrial concerns down at the waterfront they will not pay their
7% because of that you guys are going to have to pay extra to make it make up what they're not paying it's time I say
for the vental government to address this inequity of the ports Property Tax Act which frankly has gone on long
enough thank you very much thank you for your comments counselor councelor back thank you Mar little um my concern
you know I supported the 7% property tax increase this year um I can certainly appreciate that that's a large increase
and uh I want to see it Bel lower next year and into the future um but I think
when we look across the region when we look at what some of these projects are costing um you know it's just a reality
of of the environment that we're in right now um I can appreciate the comments around living within our means
um but the reality is you know we're talking about um things like uh turf fields like pickle ball courts
potentially um like active Transportation routes and things that our community really expects uh these
are priorities that that were made um by this Council so I I don't want to see uh
lower taxes to you know at the expense of some of these really important Community amenities that I think our
community really expects and and wants to see um you know upgrades to some of our parks and and various facilities
within those Parks I think are are really important um right now um I'm often concerned about small business as
well and and the impact that these sorts of tax increases have um although I do
support the even distribution right now because I do think um we want to try and
you know respect what the the level of increase that residents are seeing um
but hopefully we can assist particularly small business through um different ways uh I know we have our Economic
Development strategy that will be presented to council very soon um so I'm hoping that there are going to be some actions in there for instance where we
can where we can assist U some of the small businesses in our community um but
I think at this time the even distribution makes sense although you know I do hope that we we won't see this
level of tax increase moving forward and with regards to the wastewater treatment plant I'm hopeful that there is going to
be some appetite from around the region to to share that cost a little differently um and not put the burden
all on Northshore residents which I don't think is fair uh these costs didn't escalate they were they were not
anything that um the residents here on the NorthShore did uh so I I'm hopeful that they we're going to see some
movement there but uh I will support the recommendation thank you councelor back
councelor ma thank you uh at the recent tax
Workshop that uh members have referred to I recall that we all recognize that
there are competing interests and there are many things that we want to do to keep the district a great place to
live however I've also heard that we need to watch our expenses and the term keeps coming up we need to live within
our means we really don't want to be facing another 7% tax increase next year
at the same time we need to have policies that support local Industries and small businesses we struggle to find that
balance at this point all things consider I I support an even distribution of the of the tax increase
thank you very much see no further speakers on the matter prepared to call the question
all those in favor contrary minded motion carries thank you very much
8.4 Housing Supply Act - Housing Target Progress Reporting for the - District of North Vancouver, October 1, 2023 – March 31, 2024
okay the next item is item 8.4 this is the housing Supply act housing Target progress reporting for the district
North Vancouver October 1st 2023 to March 31st 2024 Mr Milburn I'll look to
you uh thank you very much your worship members of council members of the public uh Miss Tina ATA manager or pardon me uh
director of planning is going to be uh uh coming forward and giving a brief
presentation just wanted to note that this is the result of the housing Supply Act and the housing Target order the
district received um in late September early October of last year a couple key
messages uh it's notable that the amount of occupancies that will be shown is in
excess of what the provincial government indicated as a minimum requirement um I do note however that development
activity fluctuates predominantly from the timelines of developers and how quickly they construct um so this can
fluctuate year to year also notably the numbers of applications that we have
numbers of units under application we have in process uh demonstrates that if those units uh achieve the policies of
the district and are approved and ultimately built that the district could see the amount of units anticipated by
The Province as are need in the district so those are some of the key messages and I'd like to pass it off to miss
abon thank you welcome thank you very much good evening your worship members of council this item is the housing
Target progress report our first one in the order given to us from the province like again it was last fall when the
province of BC issued a housing Target order for the district the order gives
us a minimum number of net new completed housing units to achieve within five
years it also sets annual targets and gives us a schedule of reporting
essentially at six months and then at every year point so the first six-month
reporting period was from October 1st 2023 to March 31st 2024 so this short
presentation focuses on this time
period what I'd like to point out as well that in the council report the
attachment number one is actually the progress report which is proposed and required to be provided to the province
attachment to actually contains the order from the minister these few Graphics will show
the progress that we have been making and I'll just point out that the words on the left are not going to change but
the graphics on the right will change to help demonstrate where we've come to date again
2838 net new housing completed units is to be completed by September 30th
20128 and the one-year Target is 499 completed
units and again just want to say completed housing units are those that have achieved occupancy they're are
occupied they've been occupied since September 30th or they're ready to be occupied so the grant the the total
number of units that have received ready for occupancy less those that have been
demolished so that is why the net number comes into play so 499 units is our Target for year
one if we were to look at halfway through the first year which is essentially where we are now that we
divide 499 by two ly 250 housing units in that first six
months the district has achieved 388 net new completed housing units in this
first six month period so this puts us on track to to to meet or exceed the
one-year Target of 499 just would like to spend a couple
minutes looking at the fiveyear Target now again 2,838 units shown on the right hand side
the six-month Mark shown in dashed at the bottom if we were to look at six-month segments all the way through
again this is for demonstration purposes and especially for this first six-month reporting period which is the only
six-month reporting period this light green box shows the
388 units that we've uh seen achieve occupancy since September
30th and to give an indication of where we might be going and how we might meet the progress in five years we've
added on this light green box which shows 2,614 multif family units that have been
approved for rezoning and are moving through the remaining approval processes being development permit construction of
course we the market will fluctuate and that there the amount of development will vary from year to year but this
does give us an indication that not only are we on track for the first six months that we may be well on track for the
entire five years of course we will need to see how how things unfold the recommendations before
Council today are to receive the staff report the staff report includes the progress report that's required to be
submitted to the province we are required to do that submit this to the province within 45 days we are also then
required to post this information on our website as soon as practical staff will continue to monitor
our housing progress and units that reach completion with the next update
anticipated or required shortly after September 30th
2024 thank you okay I'll be moving the recommendations both of them is there a
second on the matter second by councelor Hansen um my own comments on it um I
guess one thing I would look to staff for as a response is um when we built the Seymour local plan
as an example the old Seymour local plan we said that you could borrow from one segment to the other in order to sort of
be able to smooth it out over time because you may have a situation where um units were being uh created um you
know all at once and then you may have a period of time where nothing else comes forward you alluded to it at the beginning Mr Melbourne um do we have the
ability to report to the province the averaging or do we have to um uh is it
is our compliance going to be based on that particular
segment uh thank you very much your worship um in early consultation with
the province uh they indicated that they understand that there are other Market forces and other reasons why approvals
may occur at at not a consistent rate approximately 500 units a year um and
that they would essentially if say we um didn't have as many occupancies as the
Target in a particular year what the province would essentially do is is um come in and meet with staff and look at
what were the issues around the approvals was it directly related to a Market Force or was it something related
to an action of the district and um and really just try to further understand and learn about the changes and so I
think that there is recognition from the provincial government um and and that you know ultimately we're all trying to
achieve the same goal which is to um address housing needs in the community um in this U particular Circumstance the
province has set a set a goal and they're looking to track that over time um which is their public objective and
um however there is recognition that there is variability over time as well I was just going to say you know I think
that the um uh from my conversations with members of the development Community uh there were a lot of them
hope hoping we'll say that the interest rates would have dropped in the last Go Round And instead the interest rates
held and so I think under a tremendous amount of pressure they were really optimistic that that that round of
interest rates was going to drop with hopefully another round later in the year um and so it will be interesting to
see how many of them may delay their start at this time um now obviously
we're going to be measuring completions but you may have a bit of a gap moving through the system if they're anticipating waiting for um preferable
borrowing conditions uh compared to what we have for construction Bridge financing right now um and so you may
have a bit of a gap built in just simply because um they're anticipating risk um
in their in their project um so it's uh I I hope that we're able to provide a
sort of smooth completion that generally reflects things but uh some of those
things are are outside of our hands they are they are tied to the economic conditions the risk profiles that the
development Community is comfortable with and um and I think probably for the
next little bit there there may be some delays and starts as they uh wait for those preferable conditions um but uh
I'll be supportive of uh the um uh a receipt and referring the matter to uh
referring the report to the provincial government in compliance with the housing Supply act uh councelor Hansen
yeah thank you very much your worship and thank you to staff for the uh corer ANF housing Target uh progress report
which was prepared which I read with great interest a lot of detail there uh the housing order calls for us to
produce 2,838 homes in 5 years a very interesting how uh close that is to the
3,28 units that we' completed in the last five years um I remain at a loss to
know why uh we were singled out uh in such a prominent way for this housing
order when what was mandated Upon Us apparently it was done with objective metrics I'd be fascinated to know those
objective metrics uh when the order that was imposed upon us is actually to produce less housing than we have been
producing um anyway that's the truth and that's where we're at we're well on track to live up to the order as is
stated uh one uh concern that I have and that I would note is that um as we have
gone along I've been a consistent advocate for rental housing uh below Market housing um uh support of Housing
and just using this snapshot of the 388 net new which is the last 6 months
that's 290 Market strata uh only 98 Randall and of that only 90 purpose
built rent seven secondary suets and Coach houses so I do hope going forward
and I know there's information in the uh housing Target progress report which
would uh make us believe that going forward we are going to achieve a greater proportion of uh purpose built
rental U uh affordable housing and uh Supportive Housing but it it's something
I think we definitely need to keep an eye on because if all we do in the next five years is replicate what we did in
the last five years uh we're not going to create any housing affordability we may create housing but it's not going to
be housing affordability um with those comments again I I thank staff for all the work involved and uh look forward to
these updates and look forward to working during the next five years towards rental affordable and Supportive
Housing thank you thank you councelor Hansen councelor mury I'm just wondering thank you m little I'm just wondering if
staff could just explain appendix B the housing unit breakdown and what those numbers refer
to is that the total number of what we're talking about in regards to the uh
the larger number that the province thought we weren't going to achieve
it's on page 74 threee worship um I'm assuming that
pendix b is the housing unit breakdown as guidance so those are currently guidelines provided by The Province
they're not part of the order at this time um as part of the reporting back to the province they've asked for that as
supplemental information which we have provided but they are not part of the order so they have determined these
guidelines for all municipalities are just for us they've included it for all
the 10 municipalities correct right so just on um you know in regards to these
numbers um uh below Market uh is
657 units of below Market is that that's
rental units right okay so below Market according to
the province is determined by number of rental units which are at or below 30%
of local housing income so it's called Hills it's a program um so 30% below
Market um but rental units Market the guideline is
1,541 the strata units are
1,297 so I have to ask the question and this was one of the biggest disappointments with this legislation
that the provincial government has laid out is that they didn't focus on the 30%
below Market rental to create affordability the
largest part of the um Supply that will be coming online will still be Market
will still be Market rental a a studio in lower Lawnsdale right now is well
last year it was $2900 a month for a studio in low still
2900 like who can afford $2,900 that's a mortgage payment not not rental how can
a young person working you know in gr mountain or Seymour or you know capalo
suspension bridge how can they afford to pay $3,000 a month you know plus
utilities and just life the fun stuff right maybe getting a car your first car
right so the province is focused on giving us guidelines um and only shooting for a
third of the market units for rental affordability I would have been all over
championing the legislation if the province had said we're going to require
30% of units in all strata and Rental uh projects to be 30% below Market to be
affordable um but we were utterly disappointed to find out that this legislation and the
removal of our municipalities all the municipalities in this province zoning
Powers which is the one power that we have is land use the province has
removed that from our ability um and they are um not focusing on affordable
housing which and we've done it the mayor of uh bernabe Mike Hurley he is
one of the fastest growing municipalities in the Lower Mainland he said we've done density they are
building 30 40 50 60 story Towers he said it's not bringing the price down
nothing's happening to the cost of those units they continue to go up so this the
supply and demand uh rule of uh decades ago is not working in this community why
because when you have three ski hills in your backyard when you have beaches um at your door doorstep when you have
worldclass Trails uh when you were an hour and a half away from one of the um greatest places to ski in the world uh
there is a price to that location location location um I'm disappointed
that um The Province doesn't trust us we've been doing this for a long time we spent millions of dollars creating a
community plan um looking at Town centers to drive density and uh we've
been fighting for affordability and um unfortunately we're losing and uh I don't think that the plan that
the province has is is helping thank you councelor I will just
say you know be careful what we wish for I mean the challenge is that while these
are currently guidelines um uh they are um they're not
requirements under the order um and if the government just simply made them requirements under the order without
providing the source of funds to attain that that affordability then they're going to assume that we're going to be
using our tax base to be paying for bringing down the the housing cost which means we' have to raise taxes on
everybody in order to produce non-market affordable units in the mix um the you
know the the studies that we have that suggest that the um we would have to
produce nine full Market units in order to be able to actually have uh if you
take a a little bit off of each one and put it into um an affordable unit then
um it would take nine Market in order to pay for one unit to be um meet our definition of affordable housing and so
um the you know if you go into Towers you get a ratio of five to one um the
guidelines suggest that we're going to produce one to one um and I there's no
uh path to doing that um with the resources that are available to us from um our own um capabilities the
programming Federal programming all of the agencies that we work with through BC housing cmhc metro Vancouver uh
there's no path to that one to one and so if if it did become an order then I
think the assumption would be that we would raise property taxes to have to pay for that affordability which is
obviously counter uh because you you'd be raising everybody's costs as well so
um at this point we're we're focusing on what's in the order and then trying to identify what is just healthy for our
community going forward I think a healthy Community has a mixture of uh tenure options and um uh uh sizes and
shapes and all kinds of things so that people can move through the through the community um but there's no way that you
we have a path towards a onetoone um uh delivery of affordable units uh it just
it's it it would take a tremendous amount of um of public benefit to
produce that obviously where we contribute land we um we try to seek as
low cost as we can uh as deep dive social and affordable housing where we can but um I don't see a path towards a
one: one uh available to us uh councelor M additional
comments I don't have anyone else in the speaker list um I guess my point mayor
little is that um your microphone on okay oh
um I think mayor little my point is is um and I think there's um some uh uh
where you look on the graph I'm not sure if it's in the housing targets graph from The Province or if it's within our
own but the loss of units the net loss of units of affordable housing so if we
were to include um the number of units that were lost through Redevelopment for instance like Emery how many units we
lost up there um you know that would have played into a a better way to look
at this this whole picture rather than assuming when you tear something down and build something new even if it is
below Market somehow it's going to be better for the community in our case and in many municipalities it wasn't better
it was worse um I understand we don't have a path forward but it seems to me
that we as municipalities um within the new legislation are being asked to do more and um I wish that the same
requirement within the velopment community and I understand the issues of the costs the challenge behind the one:1
but hindsight the 2020 it's too bad we didn't you know push further and try to
protect the affordable housing that we had instead of tearing it down and displacing it and hence we find
ourselves in this very challenging situation um and I guess the other thing that the provincial government I wish
that they would look at is you know maintaining existing rental that's affordable old rental and requiring
owners and land Lords to protect that level of housing through increased maintenance I know it costs money but it
is it's a business and uh the more we rip down the more displaced um we're
going to find more of a our population in and that's not good for anyone thank you counselor I see no further speakers
on the matter I'm prepared to call the question all in favor contrary minded motion is carried thank you very much uh
8.7 Traffic Calming Solutions in Edgemont Village
item 8.5 was passed in consent at the beginning of the meeting item 8.6 was referred to the end of the meeting so
we'll be doing 8.7 and 8.8 uh before uh next uh next item 8.7 is the traffic
calming solutions for Edgemont Village uh councelor muy this is your
report um so I bring this I bring this motion forward um there was a motion
that uh Council brought forward uh last year a year and a half ago um and we uh
it was a motion that was unanimously um passed it was talking about the speed in
Edgemont and I'm asking staff to bring forward solutions to deal with that speed uh we had a report that staff
brought forward in regards to um the fact that um uh the speed had really not
changed within the Edgmont Highland area um they did some data collection from outside the area and we had a workshop
and talked more about 30 kilometer zones in the rest of the municipality than focusing in on the area of Edgemont um I
think many of us on Council um had a concern that the issues that were
presented within that uh Council motion were not dealt with by staff and um so
we had the workshop and then I um uh moved to bring forward
uh motion to be a little bit clearer um that Council and the community the
business Community the Community Association the surrounding community of Edgemont is very interested in slowing
traffic down um we were um uh under the
impression that staff believed that there was a warrant for a full traffic light on Edgemont and Highland Boulevard
and that caused a great concern within the community Association uh the business Business Association in
Edgemont and um ourselves and so this motion is um asking staff to look at
everything but a full light at Edgemont and Highland and certainly safety is of
the utmost importance but we recognize that there are many Tools in uh the
engineering toolkit to look at slowing traffic down that is raised uh raised
speed tables uh speed bumps curb bulges pedestrian activated uh light certainly
walking across uh Edgemont the boulevard is um difficult especially seniors
walking from one sidewalk to the next there's two rows of angled parking two lanes and a median and certainly um
pedestrian activated signal would be um something that we would absolutely
support um we are also um aware of um
the warrants for and this is not in the motion but if somebody's willing to um
uh uh if the seconder is willing to uh approve uh a friendly amendment I would
also ask staff to report back on the installation of a full light at Frederick and Mountain um we have some
concerns that rat running would um be created through that installation um I think Council many of
us have been talking about these issues putting full lights in we're trying to slow people down but we also don't want
people going into the outside neighbor neighborhoods um we do need to have a workshop on this going forward mayor
little um but certainly um the ambience of the village is uh not conducive to
another light in the center of it and we would ask staff um that they come back
um with funding options and alternatives to a full light at Edgmont and also
report back on Frederick second it I'm actually going to intercede a little bit on the on the
addition of Frederick so I uh it it's not in the original report it's not something that Council was warned about
it's not something that staff had an opportunity to comment on it so at this point I'm going to consider that portion
is being out of order with the original motion uh but um we can definitely um uh
work towards getting staff prepared and and and Reporting back on that um but I
I wouldn't take the decision without having staff had an opportunity to investigate the matter and talk about
the state of things there so so I I think I would be willing to allow it to be um that it would be the initial the
original motion but then also uh that um that staff report back on feasibility
options for Traffic Control at Frederick that we would be asking for that that would be with that I don't
think that that's actually um making the decision on it it's just going to get us more information be okay with that is
that okay to the seconder yes thank you very much okay thank you very councelor
mury has actually I guess officially now you're the seconder okay uh councelor Pope additional comments thank you very
much uh I support this motion I don't think anyone wants to see a traffic light at Highland and Edgemont uh and I
would also like to propose uh an amendment um and that Amendment would be
to direct staff to use dnv's 2014 Edgmont plan and design guidelines when
implementing Solutions this was a report that was created uh extend ensive
consultation with the community with experts with planners with our staff in
2014 uh to increase the safety while also providing a vision for Edgemont
Village to be more welcoming pedestrian friendly and
beautiful so I would like to put that Amendment on the table and um I have
more to say on it seconded okay and so on the amendment this is to
uh use the 2014 plan to guide the implementation of traffic calming and
services around the area is that amendable to the original yeah C certainly staff would refer to that
document as it's as it's within you know the uh the district forw doesn't sound like it's in conflict with the original
motion so I'm okay with that it's accepted okay so then um uh I'll call
the question on the amendment is there any other discuss discussion on the amendment that's now been moved and secreted by councilor pop and
M yes I would like to have further discussion on on the amendment yeah please okay thank you um so this
amendment actually broadens the scope and provides more of a vision for Edgmont and not just one corner of it um
and the reason I'm pursuing the discussion of it here is because uh actually this report has sat on the
Shelf Gathering dust for 10 years um and so I want to make it clear at this point
that um this is this is what we want um that we want a vision and we want
specific guidelines on how to create spaces in edgman Edgemont so it's safer
pedestrian friendly inclusive and beautiful like a little village in Europe and all of that is in this report
from 2014 it will also attract local and international visitors and
make it a hub for families interaction with neighbors and
fun um so many examples of what could be
done uh can already be found in lower lawdale the city of Vancouver and around
the world and guess what 10 years after those Initial Ideas came out the
research is in and it turns out that just by putting in paint Otherwise Known
these days as ashalt art a street can be made safer and I have a video that two
minutes short uh that I want to play if we could do that from
the gives some examples here we go of what can be done
so I guess we don't have
audio n right these
are visuals of cities around the world that as you can see have engaged
citizens and uh laid out plans for painting and the most astounding thing
is um a study published in the Washington Post post found that because
of these efforts um a 50% reduction in crashes involving pedestrians and
cyclists and a 27% increase in drivers yielding to
pedestrians uh with the right of way just because of paint so uh to me I don't think we
should just be focusing focusing on engineered Solutions and instead take
take the advice of some very smart people who used to work in this building and a few who probably still do and plan
to implement some of these ideas starting with
paint or those foam bricks they had on April 1 where you walked across the crosswalk and you held a brick and you
made people stop okay thank you very much uh
councilor mury you the second on the amendment is that okay uh councelor back are you for the
amendment to the main motion I want to speak to both on the amendment first I'll get
another opportunity on the me thank you thank you very much and thank you councelor muy for bringing the motion forward um I too uh want to see uh I do
do not want to see a new Full signal there at Highlands in Edgemont um I certainly want to see um traffic cing in
Edgmont Village um and as we saw from your motion that you brought forward and the 30k pilot uh a 30k speed limit alone
does not slow down drivers um traffic signals um give priority to Vehicles
over pedestrians and I've always thought that uh Edgemont Village um could be so
much more uh could be so much more of a people oriented vibrant space uh where where families kids felt safe um and I
always like to com use the the analogy that if a community is safe for kids it's safe for just about anybody um and
I've never felt that that uh core of of of the village is and so I do think it's
physical infrastructure that's needed but um as it was highlighted here in in councelor Pope's Amendment there's so
much that can be done with just paint um and uh and so I I would love to see um
this amendment and this motion be the start of a of a bit of a transformation
of Edgmont into into a village that's much more as I say people oriented in a place that um is just not so car doin
and yes it's about slowing down speeds and I think that's you know that's at the heart of how we start this um but
then it's about creating um activating the space uh through the way it's it's
engineered through the types of programming that will'll you know be able to offer in in some of the expanded
areas that are not so much about um cars so um very support of of seeing this be
the direction of how we um slow down traffic through the village and uh and
very supportive of it thank you thank you very much on the amendment any further discussion to call the question
on the amendment all those in favor contrary minded motion is carried the item is amended back to the original
motion um uh councelor back you had some additional comments on the original motion
um I think um I'm hoping that we can see how the funding will work here I know
with the TransLink funding it was tied to the full signal but I'm hoping that staff will be able to um report back on
how we could potentially apply some of that funding towards a different traffic calming solution um but uh no I think
I've kind of covered in my previous comments I just don't think that a traffic signal is is going to um create
this the safety that we want uh in that area of the village we just um some of my own
comments on the matter um you know we I I'm always cautious about us getting
into making a political decision around a safety matter um I think we we do
always have to um refer to our experts to advise us on what's appropriate but
again there's more than one way to achieve our safety goals in the community um unless you have a very
extreme situation uh we're obviously not going to in and around a highway exchange we're probably not going to
rely on paint to manage uh manage risk in Affairs but in in Village context and
town centers it's something that could could be very functional um so I I'm
very cautious about us um interfering where a warrant study has said that we have to upgrade something and we make a
political decision not to upgrade something or that we make a political decision to do something uh dramatically
different that doesn't have the same kind of um outcomes having said that um I will be supportive of uh this matter
generally um I I'm I will put back out there if if if
the experts feel that there's there's no way this can adequately protect
residents or it misdirects residents into a riskier situation that I do want them to be reporting back to us on on
that matter I would not want to create a situation where uh that's an issue um
you know when you think about accessibility in our community and I've spent a tremendous amount of time on the
advisory committee on disabilities issues um we have some leading
technologies that we use uh called apps which is The Pedestrian signal system the chirps and beeps and stuff that we
have at our uh intersections in our town that's something that lots of other places don't have and it helps remove
barriers to people in need to uh move around the community so um you know as
we look at upgrades to the Edgemont area there may be something said to make some of the decisions based on General
accessibility um in the community uh combined with safety um uh but I also
worry that the um a full signalization of this intersection um would fairly dramatically change uh the feel of this
area and you're already between two signalized intersections um in the in the space so uh I'm open to uh using e
other methods whether it's paint or whether it's um race crosswalks or signalization of a more modest nature
you be pedestrian oriented signals or or others um I will also say that you know
one of the things that we've got four kids in the community and and I tell them not to trust paint um uh just
because a crosswalk is painted doesn't mean you still don't have to make eye contact with the driver um and just
because we've done a lovely big mural outside of brymar elementary school is an example it doesn't mean that that's a
play space for pedestrians in any way shape or form you still have to uh recognize the inherent risk of being
sharing your space with a vehicle um because it is inherently risky for pedestrians to be in the same space so
don't trust paint uh but it does help to um uh
to elevate the awareness of drivers to pedestrians moving through that space and so it's generally a good a positive
thing so I'll be supportive of this um and look forward to hearing back from our staff about um uh what treatment
they would recommend in the space uh as an interm measure uh councelor Forbes
additional comments thank you worship um yeah just
a couple comments um I think everything that's been said
is good I agree with you mayor that when it comes down to actual safety I think
that's something we have to look to our engineers and our experts for that's not our expertise around Council so um with
that in mind I'd also like to say that I I have been a proponent of updating a
lot of Dusty um reports sitting on shelves and so I'm really glad that this
has come forward and but I would also like to encourage staff then to look at the 2014 report in light of 10 years
later because we do have a lot more traffic there's different kind of Housing and Development that is now
there in Edgemont so 2014 study is a great start um but just to look at it in
the way the situation is now 10 years later and then just sort of adding one
more thing we just talked about paint two weeks ago and how uh the paint used
down at the exchange by Modi is gone disappeared we we've also had um some of
our uh Pride sidewalks where the paint disappears in two years and Council Mary
brought forward um information about possible um paints that would last
longer and would illuminate at night so I'd like to ask when staff looks at this
that they also look at that a different type of paint more last long lasting
longer if that's the route we go and also again because we've been talking
budgets the cost of that kind of implementation thank you thank you very
much uh I see no further speakers but we have had some changes to the motion that are not actually on the screen yet so
I've asked jenevie if she would be willing to uh uh read out the amended motion thank you through your worship
the amended motion on the floor right now is that Council direct staff to implement engineering solutions to calm
traffic in Edgemont Village rather than the proposed traffic signal at Edgemont in Highline Boulevard and that Council
direct staff to report back on funding options for proposed engineered Solutions and that coun and that staff
report back on feasibility options for Traffic Control at Frederick and that Council direct staff to use DMV's 2014
Edgemont plan and design guidelines when implementing solutions to increase safety while also making Edgemont
Village more welcoming pedestrian friendly and beautiful Frederick at Mountain Highway
thank you okay is everyone clear on the motion being considered at this time okay
prepare to call the question all those in favor contrary minded motion carries thank you very much bio break okay the
8.8 Pickleball Courts Expansion
next item up for discussion is uh item 8.8 this is the pickle pole pts
expansion councelor Pope it's your your report would you like to make your motion
please uh my motion is to uh V Council direct staff to identify sites where new
outdoor pickle ball courts could be located and where current courts could
be expanded in the district of North Vancouver is there seconder on that motion seconded by councelor back okay
Council Pope your comments thank you very much well as some of you know around this table and in the audience I
play a little pickle ball I discovered it during covid and
like so many others I became a pickle ball addict quite quickly
it keeps me and other players active it gets us off the couch exercising and
socializing it's cheap and accessible with the only investment being a paddle
uh and of course it's tons of fun the social aspect is noteworthy because that
is what makes it different than other court Sports and as we learned during
covid socialization is critical to our mental health and well-being right now
there are not enough pickle ball courts to meet current let alone future demand
in the district of North Vancouver we players know it because we see the throngs of people showing up at
courts across the NorthShore and often lining up to play and we also know it
because the soon to be released Sport Court strategy has also come to the same
conclusion I'll pick up on more on that in a moment pickle ball is the fastest
growing sport in North America and based on Regional and worldwide Trends its
popularity will continue surging exponentially while adults 58 uh aged 55
plus popularized the sport players aged 18 to 34 now represent the largest
growth in numbers in fact well over 2,000 norshore students plus their
teachers have been introduced to pickleball in the last three years alone and local schools are acquiring paddles
and teaching pickle ball as part of their curriculum so regarding the Sports Court
strategy a highlevel presentation on the strategy was presented to the parks
committee which I attended last week the report comes to the conclusion that
indeed we need more pickle ball court so I feel if we know that then let's get
moving a few locations have been identified but there are many more
possibilities that could be explored some courts could be expanded on their
current lo locations quite easily just by painting some lines the painting
theme tonight so but just by painting some lines on the current Courts at
little katees for example they could easily add two more on the current surface and we also need to look for
places where there could P potentially be pickle ball hubs or centers of at
least eight courts pickle ball players as we heard earlier tonight uh from some
of the players that spoke pickle ball players like gathering in groups to play lots of games with lots of different
players and that's why pickle ball hubs are the way most cities are going these
days bernabe Richmond Ando and many more are creating pickle ball hubs and
they're relatively easy to build because eight pickle ball courts have a
footprint comparable to two tennis courts so to sum up what my motion does
is ask staff to identify locations where additional courts could go as a hub or
where current courts could be expanded and then to bring forward a Report with
costs by then we should have the official Sports Court strategy and the north van W commission's facilities
strategy and that will help us make decisions that balance the needs of All
Sport Sports Court Sports Court players say that three
times and some of this work could be done immediately so again now that we need
more pickle ball courts let's get staff moving in that direction and I hope that voting yes to this
motion will enable that to happen thank you okay thank you very much I believe
the seconder on the matter was Council back Council back thank you Mary little um so I will be supporting the
recommendation here tonight uh and thank you councelor Pope for bringing the report forward um I myself am not a
pickle ball player but I've certainly followed the massive uh growth that this sport has uh has seen in recent years
not just in our community but all the world and uh for all the reasons that you've outlined I I I want to see uh
more opportunities for people to to play the sport um I think anything that gets people um active at at any stage age or
stage of life is is something that we need to be promoting um and there's the physical as well as the the huge social
connection piece which I think is more important than ever um that we provide opportunities for people to to gather
and and connect uh in person um you know I think things change uh at one time
tennis was very much a a dominant sport in our community um we have a lot of
tennis courts um and I'll be interested to um read the sport court strategy once
that does come forward um to council um to see how the demand for tennis looks
right now but you know I I think that um we we have a lot of tennis courts as was
highlighted by one of the speakers uh in various parts of the district um and I I
do support shared usage wherever we can um but as I say times change Trends
change and and right now pickle ball is is really surging ahead um so I think it's it's time to look at how we can you
know create more facilities and expand um current pick aall facilities um
recognizing that you know it's it is seeing such such huge growth um I know in in residential areas uh or courts
that are close to residential areas the noise is is an issue um so you know I I
understand that there's rackets now that are quite a bit quieter and that's a there's a local connection to that particular invention which I'd love to
learn more about um but you know it's something to consider when we look at where these sorts of ports are located
but um I absolutely support um you know exploring how we can uh create more um
in terms of the sport court strategy just in in sort of the initial look that was uh given by by our parks and
environment committee last week it looks as though pickle ball you know did uh did show up in that strategy um so I
think any work that is initiated through this uh recommendation tonight would would feed into that quite nicely so I
don't think it's working against that strategy it would be really informing it um so I'm happy to support
it thank you very much uh councelor back councelor Hansen your comments yeah thank you very much I I uh
agree with uh all the we've heard from councilors Pope and councelor back I
never played pickable but when I hear about these remarkable athletic and
social benefits it it may be that u i i i find myself playing pickle wall very
soon I agree there aren't enough courts that's a a message that we do hear from our community and I do support the uh
call for more courts uh we are of course going to have to consider overall cost
um we've been told that pickle ball coats are reasonably coste effective but
um as dying end with other discussions in the evening we do have to be careful
at this stage as to initiating new and expensive programs uh and we also need
to uh be careful about the way that we're reallocating uh these spaces away from
tennis but potentially also away from other uh Community uh needs U just
because very fashionable right now doesn't mean I think we should um give it a a
priority that's out of proportion given all of the different user groups across
the district but thank you councel for bringing the motion I do support uh the call for more pickle courts in North
District and I look forward to the report councelor Hansen councelor
Forbes thank you worship um it was about six years ago the first time
I got a phone call from people who played pickle ball and it was at little Kate's and I got involved with those
people out there a little bit and at the time I think there you also understood
you were involved in the fact that uh they were trying to get pickall courts there solely pickall court pickall
courts because of the lineups when the tennis courts the other set of Courts tennis courts were sitting empty and
there was a great C buffle between tennis court users and pickle Court
users so I do think that the um Sports Court strategy that the rec center is
doing which involves the rec center facilities with the District of northan
and the City of northan I think that's really really important for us to take a
arching overall look at it not just focusing on just the district but everywhere and where we can place them
um I also think at that time too there was a lot of a lot of uproar about the noise
of the sport so I think we still have to be sensitive um I'm glad that there's new equipment out that has progressed
and made it a little bit quieter but we need to be sensitive about where we're putting them
um the um I just lost my train of thought anyway I'm in favor of anything
that's going to keep our kids out active our adults out active
and in the fresh air um so I'm looking forward to the strategy Court strategy
thing to make a big difference a global difference on the NorthShore hopefully
West Vancouver is not included because I think they were at six years ago West Vancouver was not in favor of pickleball
courts I don't know where they' come cor I don't know where they've come but it would be really nice if they get on
board too anyway thank you thank you councelor Forbes councelor
Mo thank you I think I'm going to borrow a term from one of the earlier speakers
from the uh public input SE uh section I would consider myself an emerging player
I started playing pickle ball last year and I can see firsthand why people enjoy it the game is very social and people
get out I'm now playing on a regular basis many of you know that
the northan recreation and culture commission slated to come back to council with a
comprehensive Recreation and Sport facility plan later this year it will cover Fields facilities and
courts including pickleball courts we as a council has also been
approached by other members of the community about the need to complete the handsworth artificial turf
field build cover skateboard parks so borders can skate in the fall and in the
winter months and I've been approach about uh providing a facility for field
hockey I've also heard from residents who would love to have King a kerning ring back in the
district we as a council need to represent the entire community at the last Council workshop
on tax distribution many members of council spoke about spending within our
means we can't do everything this is especially relevant
on the heels of this year's 7% property tax increase in the pending situation with the NorthShore wastewater treatment
plan I don't want to make promises now that Council cannot
keep I want to be clear I enjoy playing pickle ball however I think it' be more
appropriate to make decisions about sport facilities and direction to staff after Council receives the report from
the commission thank you very much councelor Mary uh thank you mayor uh
little I almost called you mayor Bell oh I haven't done that in a long time uh
I'm just wondering if uh staff can comment in regards to um I was I'm a
council's rep on the parks and natural environment committee and Parks uh made a presentation in regards to um the
issue of pickle ball at the meeting uh last week and we had a member of uh
pickle Bal Community was there as well um and I'm just wondering if you can talk about the Synergy with what this
motion is intending which is what we're already doing I think and then maybe speak to the um work that we're doing
with the rec Commission on the needs assessment and uh the
alignment Miss Warner thank you through your worship um
yes so as um Council Mary has uh indicated we have a number of um
initiatives underway uh including looking at the full in ventory of
recreation amenities and that's work that we have uh underway in partnership with North Van W and city of North
Vancouver um our work looking at the district sport courts which includes uh
tennis pickle ball lacrosse basketball all sports that use our outdoor hard
court surfaces that work began some years ago um as the district uh
recognized the growing needs of a variety of sports including pickle ball and reference to Lil Kates has been made
where we've made uh great improvements over the last couple years to help meet that need in the E semr area so these
bodies of work are both underway concurrently with the district's work to analyze its existing inventory of
support courts uh having Advanced sooner um but concurrent to this broader piece
of work so the work that we're doing um is concurrent and
complimentary um we are analyzing our existing inventory and looking at the potential uh within it to optimize for All Sports
and that work will support the broader analysis that's underway with our
partners across North Vancouver and North vanre commission at the full inventory of indoor and outdoor um sport
courts and other uh Sport and Recreation amenities available for All Sports and
do you have an indication as to when we can expect um that information to come back to both all three bodies Rec
Mission um you may not be able to speak to that I'm not sure if Miss Turner and Mr Hunter's on the phone maybe Mr Joyce
um can speak to that um but the uh the body of work with this yeah with all
three what how how What's the timing on that this Warner three your worship um
our timing on analysis of the district's Sport Court inventory specifically uh we
anticipate having concluded that analysis with recommendation to council um we're aiming for early summer
2024 um the information that we bring forward at that time will also be considered uh within that broader
analysis and work that's underway with North Van recre uh the timing of their process uh given the magnitude and scope
of that work I can't speak to that um it's it's much deeper analysis but both
bodies of work will be complimentary and we're working very closely to ensure that thank you very much so I think the
um the motion that's been brought forward as councelor back said that this is not not in in uh conflict with as as
we move forward this work is already being done um uh that information will
be coming back to the council's or to our Council for discussion in regards to the sports Court it did sort of Jump
Ahead um in regards to the needs assessment the rec commission was looking at and certainly um the
relationship that we have with the city of North Vancouver um you know it's a a very good one we've worked very closely
over the years with our partnership uh with the rec commission and we're looking at the whole holistic uh
inventory of amenities that we have between both municipalities and uh
working towards making sure that they're all complimentary to one another and um as other counselors have talked about
making sure that we can find balance within the community uh for all the needs that um people are interested in I
mean I can add rock climbing to the list uh beach volleyball um Highline you know
the list goes on of all of the new um ways people want to recreate we are also
mapping the dark side um in the Seymour ongoing maintenance of our Trails we
have one of the most extensive Trail networks um in the world and uh it's uh
it's something that um you know takes a lot of resources uh to be able to
maintain we're working with um our partners within the provincial government currently there's one planner
for the entire south coast region um for Parks so it's challenging um so so we
have a lot on our plate um but we look forward to this body of work and um certainly this report um is just
accentuating what is already going on thank you thank you councilor mury um uh
just my own comments on the matter um you know I was happy to support the
Berto Fraser project when those spaces were created obviously very happy to support the um the katees park uh
project and and then we kind of had to pause to try to figure out what to do for Central North Vancouver um we
obviously don't want people to have to commute all over the community to be able to find it but you want to get a critical mass of Parts together to be
able to do um uh to make to make it a great experience for people um and so we
we kind of pause there um I do think that we need to create more um pickle
ball capacity within the community um I want to be very very cautious about us
always making it at the expense of tennis um I know the tennis community is
under under pressure I know that's that's sometimes the easiest thing to do is to just take it over because it's
already flat space in the community um but um tennis has seen growth too
although largely in their indoor spaces um and we don't necessarily need to have the direct conflict um between the two
I'll put something on the table that's a little bit controversial we'll say um which is to say that we have 54 Sports
fields in the district of North vanc couver uh we've been converting over to at fields to get uh a higher level of
usage each week the old the grass fields would only get about 10 hours of use before they would deteriorate um but if
the soccer Community doesn't want to be using our gravel Fields anymore they prefer to go to the artificial turf
fields then it would suggest that that in the relatively near future we'll have Surplus gravel fields and that's been a
very very dramatic change that we've seen in the last 10 years is that those
spaces um uh the clubs now are only signing up for our at uh spaces for the
kids development programs which is a huge user on those areas and so it may mean that we don't always have to take
from tennis we can we can look at um uh the other spaces in the community where
we have underutilized gravel fields and say it's already a flat note space maybe we can do something else uh with it um
if it's Surplus to our needs um so I I don't want this to just always be conflict between tennis and pickle ball
there's no reason that we can't over time uh make sure that both space both Sports have uh adequate spaces to um uh
to recreate in our community um I do think that the right place for
this is in the context of the broader needs assessment study um committing to
a project and then going and studying its place in the rest of um of the system doesn't sounds out of order to me
um it's something that we should be um going to the um needs assessment first um which won't take long it's
already underway it's already something that's being developed and so um uh we
could get the benefit of that study uh before we move forward but again the the location's got to be something that
combines uh convenience the reason why we picked cases as an example was because uh ready available of parking
ready available of washrooms ready availability of washrooms in the space relatively flat get in and out and it
was limited in terms of exposure to neighboring residential areas that you didn't have uh uh that conflict and
obviously we mitigated that with the sound fencing and other stuff that we we've done there um so it's it's it's
hard to find a totally uh great spot for pickle ball but I think uh if we
actually are studying our broader needs assessment I think we're going to find that uh we actually do have some uh
other suitable Alternatives that uh that we may not have looked at in the past particularly um potentially the flat
areas created by our um gravel Fields so um I'll I'll be supportive but I think
this needs to be in the context of the um of the study and so I'll look to
staff for their response to that actually maybe if I I know I'm out of time but just quick comment from staff
about the timing and that and and how we can incorporate that same thing for the
summer um so as mentioned our work to look at optimization of the district's
um existing inventory um that work is is well underway and well Advanced and it considers also um our work that we're
doing uh together with mvrc and cnv on that broader uh assessment that's been
referenced this evening and our we're sharing our data together also amongst
the um staff and consultant teams so um we can bring forward um preliminary uh
evaluation of the district's existing inventory uh we anticipate by summer
okay thank you very much uh second speaker profor
Pope thank you very much and I must say Mr Mayor I love your idea of using the
gravel field for other uses and especially a pickle ball
Hub there you go um so I'm hearing early summer we're
going to get one report the other report isn't coming in until the end of the year which sounds like the New Year to
me which sounds like 2025 and we already know
today April 2024 that we need more pickle ball courts
today um so the demand we have now can't wait for study more
reports um when we already know what how what the conclusion is um uh and I
wanted to just add a couple of things um the costs as well for pickle ball courts
are minimal especially when you look at just expanding some of the ones that currently exist but also it's um you
know again it's the the size of you know two tennis courts is equal to eight
pickle ball courts so you can accommodate the need uh quite easily um
but the other thing is the noise uh I realize we have to be cognizant of the
neighbors and where the pickle ball courts go which is why the location becomes especially difficult um and I
appreciate all the work that staff have done uh so far on their reports um we
know in the pickle ball community that and I believe that the future of pickle ball is in these newly designed um
rackets which I happen to have one and it's 50% quieter so if everybody's
playing with these kinds of rackets uh it'll make a very big difference and
also the sound barriers are also improving and I just wanted to add those
few comments thank you councelor Forbes additional comments
I just want to say I like your idea of the gravel fields too because nobody really wants to play on them anymore so
they're prepped I mean we'd have we'd have to do a little more but it I'd
still like to go back to also something else you said that I don't like making isolated decisions I like getting all of
the information and then making the decision and that's the best
fiscally uh and environmentally way to make a decision
and it's too bad that we come to these real I mean six years ago people were asking for pick all courts then so it's
too bad that it we seem to get to the breaking point before we say okay now we're going to do something but I don't
think that should negate the idea of doing it responsibly so I would I'm looking forward to the the full study
and how our the district can continue doing um their evaluation on our our
courts but I'm looking for the whole study and how their our evaluation will fit into that thank you thank you counc
back additional comments just as I seconded the recommendation I wanted to highlight that I don't think we're
actually making any decisions through this recommendation all it's being asked is that staff are able to report back um
with identifying some new and existing sites um so I'm okay with with that
coming forward um with a little bit more urgency than you necessarily waiting for
the whole strategy um that's all I would say is that um I think we can probably
do that we all agree that it's not it's not going against the sport court strategy so I would just like to
emphasize that it needs a little bit more urgency than waiting for all the
pieces okay uh thank you very much um yeah I I I will say you know I I took
the motion to be the same largely that it it recommend back um identifying sites but as councelor Hansen said it
was a great gate there's a there's a there's a capital question in this which is um that it it has to go through a
budget process it can't simply just be about the council just directing on on a
short whim that we're going to make these kinds of change it has to be through a capital process we have to see it in the context of the other
priorities for a community um I I I don't think that has to be a long process I heard that the report would be
by Summer I think that's not unreasonable um and um you know we also
have the capability to uh use temporary courts to expand our capacity at
different times whether that's indoor spaces with temporary courts um or we for the longest time use temporary
courts um um before we had built the dedicated spaces uh I'm not a big fan of
multi- lining uh I think that just breeds contempt and conflict in the community I think that um it does have
to be dedicated separated uh pickle ball space and just as we've had the benefit of dedicated separated tennis space in
the community um one of the big advantages I think we brought forward the last time we expanded was that um we
no longer had to have uh you know uh alter the the the Nets where people were
putting weights on the Nets to get them to be the right size that people were doing markings on the ground to to
change uh the tennis spaces I don't think that's desirable either um it it should be dedicated separated not
multi-lined uh this should be for pickle ball space where I'm with my 20 15
seconds left I will just say that you know one of the debates we had at the time that we talked about murof Fraser
was what you know how much we should focus on development and short commutes to the infrastructure that we have
versus creating that Central tournament facility um and I still think that we we
probably should be uh focusing on just making it accessible to people so they don't have to commute long distances um
and that the uh tournament size facility uh may be something that we pursue in the longer run um but um uh no I I still
think this is generally right direction I've been happy to support pickle ball in the past I just uh want to do it in a way that's not always in conflict with
uh our tennis community as well uh Council Forbes your name is up I think that's from before is that
correct okay I see no further speakers on the matter prepared to call the question all those in favor contrary
minded remot contary minded okay councelor M's contary minded okay uh
motion carries with councelor ma opposed okay uh moving on to item 8.6 uh
first okay so at nine o'clock we normally have a little bit of a break for people to stretch we do only have
one item and a report left um but if you know let's let's I I I appreciate
everybody's waited for a minute we're just going to take a two or three minute bio break for people to be able to
step out and stretch and use the washroom which is across the hall and we will resume immediately um to the item

8.6 Deep Cove Parking Review – 2024 Implementation Plan
go into the last item which is 8 8.6 uh this is the uh deep Co parking
review 2024 implementation plan uh very first off the top I've had a member of council indicate that they'd like to
recuse them themselves on the matter counselor uh Hansen if you could read into the record your reasons for recusing yourself on this thank you very
much uh this goes back to 2014 uh when this issue originally came
before me I was recently elected and I have since that time uh continue to uh
declare a potential conflict um I was advised that the source of the conflict
is because my spouse and I have a property up Indian Arm and the
suggestion was made that the value of that property the desirability of Indian arm uh ownership and use is contingent
in part on parking availability in IND in Deep Cove and I've stayed consistent
with that position so I will continue to recuse myself so because you benefit from a parking pass you'll recuse
yourself from there thank you very
much okay um I understand uh Mr Cohen we have about a five slide presentation to
um uh to present and then we'll have our discussion so over to you thank you mayor little good evening Council for
members of the public my name is Peter Cohen and I'm the director of Engineering Services I'm joined this evening by Wendel and Jordan who is our
acting manager of Transportation this evening we're coming back to council to present to you
staff's recommended implementation plan to create an incremental Improvement to the parking management strategy in Deep
Cove to help set the stage for council's discussion and deliberations I'll Just sh share a handful of
slides just as an overview the report before you is based on two years of work
as part of our work plan to revisit and update the 2015 Deep Cove parking and
access implementation plan the staff recommendation before you this evening is based on data that was collected in
2022 public engagement that occurred in early 2023 and several discussions we've
had with Council across the fall and the winter most recently at our workshop on March the
18th and lastly for context the study area in question covers the broader Deep Cove neighborhood as shown by the image
on the left in blue and is generally all areas north and east of the Mount Seymour Parkway and Deep Cove Road
intersection as a recap to the staff recommendation the image on the left is
a reminder that we have approached our implementation recommendation in trying to strike a balance between the parking
needs of residents businesses and visitors in Deep Cove we know that there are many
frustrations within our community as it relates to problematic parking and and circulation within Deep Cove and our
recommendation accommodates the needs of all three groups but we recognize that no single group can get everything that
they desire the proposed recommendation before you is not intended to resolve
all of the transportation issues in Deep Cove it's rather intended to be an incremental Improvement and a step in
the right direction the two images on the right hand side provide a snapshot of the changes being proposed by staff
key aspects include a qu Drupal of Resident only on street parking spaces
in Deep Cove this is an increase of hundreds of
spaces having approximately 70% of all on street parking being prioritized for
residents in some manner there's also a roughly doubling of time limited spaces to encourage higher turnover spaces and
also in maintaining unrestricted on Street spaces that are within walking distance to Key
destinations one key message to remind council is that staff's approach to this proposed parking strategy is by taking a
holistic neighborhood level look at this issue usually we would look at parking on a street by- street level as we start
to hear complaints and concerns this is no longer effective in Deep Cove as this will simply move the problem around and
so the staff recommendation tries to look at a broader strategy that removes a neighborhood a neighbor first neighbor
or Street by Street scenario in terms of the feedback that staff heard on March 18th at the
workshop you will see a lot of this reflected in the staff report before you firstly we heard General consensus from
Council that the previously proposed 10: a.m. start to Any Time restrictions was considered too late staff have made
modifications based on this feedback and are now providing a recommendation for these time limits to start at 8:00 a. we
also heard a number of considerations being brought forward from certain counselors whether this be the possibility of on Street paid parking a
titer control on managing traffic in and out of Deep Cove consideration of reintroducing a shuttle service where
technology could be considered maximizing RPO spaces and reducing time restrictions down from 3 hours to two
hours all of these elements that we heard from the workshop have been provided by staff in the report either
through commentary or through the options that are provided for you we also know that some members of council
have expressed inquiries relating to some type of parking exemptions for Deep Cove business employees and staff have
shared further information with Council on that matter in the interest of time I'll wrap
up here but I have staff available for any questions that we have for Council thank you just before you U leave the
table we'll just double check so there were a number of questions that came in in the public input period specifically around the issuance of passes how many
per household is it consistent across um the uh the community and is there a
charge for that first one or additional um passes being issued to a house sure
so the answer to that question is that we're taking a holistic approach across deep C where passes would be provided as two
parking passes for a household with a flex pass for visitors to be used as well uh the cost of that service uh or
the fee for that would be roughly $35 um and that's in line with our fee for service perspective that we provide
to any fee that we have for these types of passes $35 per year as a nominal
recovery fee for our staff time is that correct that is correct M little uh this is all to uh recover administrative
costs for these types of passes thank you very much okay I'm going to give you a chance to
speak in just a moment uh but you're not the first speaker on the list so I'm just going to check with uh uh councelor
ma do you have a motion on the matter yes uh first Peter thank you for
the report and thank you to your staff for taking the time to S you're moving
the staff recommendation is that correct well I want to actually propose
amendment is this the time or uh since you're the mover you can
move it with whatever wording you want to okay I'm going to move it I'll decide if
it's in order if it Alters the motion but but you can you can propose it with an amendment it without an amendment you
it's just the motion right I want to uh move it with an amendment sure okay so this
was um I apologize I I thought the uh clerk had a copy of this um this is an
amendment for staff to further invest instigate not withstanding the report the information we got earlier today but
that the staff be directed to further investigate the options feasibility and approach for exempting employees of Deep
Cove businesses to certain parking restrictions before March 31st 2025 so
it's going ahead but staff would have time to look at these issues a little deeper uh so that staff may provide
recommendations based on current on-site observations and feedback following the implementation of the new parking
management Tools in Deep Cove ahead of the 25 2025 peak season moving the staff
recommendation with the inclusion of exploring uh Workforce parking space
Provisions yes I'll second seconded by councelor m okay councelor M on the on
the motion right you know um I think staff
have a very challenging situation um as Peter mentioned you know the
report's good but it may not be perfect because there's a lot of issues that are still unaddressed in the community
um at this point I'm willing to take a bit of leap of faith because the staff
report covers a lot of issues but I hope after a year we would um revisit some of
the things that may be still outstanding and one of the things that potentially is an issue isue is whether businesses
in in Deep Cove will have enough um parking for their staff because if they
don't that's going to potentially become an issue for them to get staff and run
their businesses so um I'm generally
supportive that this was a a best attempt at addressing the three different uh groups user groups the
businesses the visitors and the residents okay thank you very much Council M your
comments is it $35 per pass Mr
Cohen yes so through the mayor it's $35 overall for the application do all
Resident parking only areas in the district
pay through the mayor yes upper Lin pay I'll take that away and we can
confirm and there's I'd like to know the the um the number of passes that different areas get versus The Cove um
that should come back so I will um support um councelor Moss but I'd like I have a number of amendments as well that
I'd like to add okay um so my Amendment to the
amendment uh would be that we include rurn Parkside Lane Lock Haven and
cliffmont with with a variety of seasonal RPO and Resident exempt time
permitted parking okay is there a seconder for that amendment seconded by councelor Ma okay so discussion on the
amendment councelor we'll we'll have if you you have it written down yeah we'd like to
provide that to um and um
i' sorry oh and I'd also like to have um
the extension of Cove Cliff go to the top of Strath Kona with the same variety
is Staff listening or
okay I've just got two areas and the four areas that were brought up um by Mr
Floyd in the workshop are the same streets that I'm talking about so I'm
just looking at Lock Haven Rayburn Parkside Lane and cliffmont to have the
same variety as the other areas around the core and I'd like kof Cliff to go to the
top of Strath clona and include Roxbury Place because that's the
circle okay and soor this is a second amendment or that or you're just repeating what was in the amendment that
councelor Ma support So counselor ma is wanting uh the review for um employee
Park working I agree with motion that was actually that's already in the original motion yes so this is the
amendment to that motion okay and and but the streets that you just listed those are the ones that you initially
listed as the amendment therefore they were seconded by councelor m is that correct yesk you very rurn Park Side
Lane Lock Haven cliffmont and then the kof cliff goes to the top of stth kona and then that the review take place in
the fall of 2024 as an initial review so we can
understand what happened this summer and not wait until next fall but I'm fine
with the employee issue waiting till next fall or maybe we can bring that forward earlier and then the final one would be
to address um 2151 Banbury it's a multif family complex it
was the first one that was built in Deep Cove they have no visitor parking zero
and they would like um resident exemption okay so just to be clear
councelor M are you considering this all you're supporting all of this including the last one that was mentioned or would
you like me to break them out as separate amendments I'm I'm trying to get them down to but generally up supportive if
there was a bunch of issues that I bunch of concerns I had with the original plan but I was
prepared to let it play out for a year but if councelor Murray's bringing them
up now I'm supportive I just didn't to be honest I didn't want to go Street by street I'll consider them all as one
Amendment then ccor mury and my last one my this my last one take could just
breathe just through it's I know I'm driving you crazy but just um and then my last one would be to um split more
evenly um Cliffwood Lane um there was a speaker that has been um speaking on a regular basis um
Sonia who lives in that community and um uh the split of 8020 needs to be more
balanced it's a very small area with a very steep um uh
incline again I'm checking with councelor ma is that all one
Amendment I'll keep it simple yes thank you them that all as one Amendment okay
on the amendment councelor Mir uh thank you um so I recognize that um
My Wish of putting resident parking only um throughout the entire uh area north
of Mount semour parkway at Deep Cove Road into Deep Cove is a big huge ask
and I I I completely support um the impact of the businesses um coming from
a small business family and one um who worked on Gallant for over 10 years um
so um and I understand that taking away resident parking later is going to be a
challenge so I I will agree for this gradual implementation but I think
what's missing is the understanding of how this community operates and the
geography of it this community was built in the 1930s and for earlier than that
in the 40s and 50s where there were no permits for houses they were little Cottages that existed no one cared about
little Deep Cove build a house wherever you want half the people on Panorama put driveways on our roads that's why we
have licenses to occupy for garages because they didn't build them on their own properties they built them on a road
um the Steep incline of some of these areas the access points the access points in and out of
an area um doing u-turns in the middle of the road you need to I looked on the
map um last week when we got the report and I noticed that the intersections of
some of these areas there were little white areas um suggesting that that's where you don't park but if you go down
there on a weekend there are people parked on the corners of the
intersection um I'll take my other two minutes actually on an amendment you don't get another two minutes isn't that
correct that's correct okay so so you could wrap up on I implore that these
air these additional amendments that I've added um are going to make it more
of a middle ground for people um it is going to be um more reasonably accepted
by the community and I think it's going to go farther to address the issue when we do get back to the main motion you
will have an additional you will you absolutely will councel ma your comments on the amendment
please just say what she said
there are there's a lot of good work here and the staff have taken a lot of time what
I find with the Amendments they probably fine-tuned some issues that were brought up so I appreciate councilor Murray for
bringing that and I appreciate her supporting the uh my motion that I made
regarding the uh employees so that's it thank you okay um um I'll speak on the
amendment um I'm having difficulty with this I think that the staff have done a
lot of work to identify an incremental step uh towards it I never saw it as a a
final um uh parking plan entirely but it would be very hard to fully Implement
RPO and then bring it back tailor it back there's no question the community would respond extremely negatively to
that and so it's about moving uh creating additional RPO space but also
recognizing all of the other uses that are that are in the space um particularly making sure that businesses
can be properly supported uh with um um adequate turnover of parking spaces in
in the neighborhood um I I you know one place I would go beyond the staff
recommendation was um I thought Park signed lanen should have been identified as fully RPO uh there is no safe
turnaround on Parkside Lane you have to turn around on people's private property up into their driveways whereas largely
the other streets at least have a bulb or a place that you can turn around in in some way um and so I thought that
that should have been there above and beyond the staff recommendation but um I'm I'm going to be supportive of the uh
recommendation that councelor Ma put on the floor as a motion but I will not be
supportive of the amendment um I think it goes too far I think it um it it
gives um uh private private exclusive use of public
property without Fair compensation to the municipality and the public as a whole uh but it also uh calls into
question whether we're going to be supporting our businesses adequately uh they they make no money in the off
season so many of those businesses uh struggle every single winter and for us
to come down and clamp down on on the One season that they actually make money
on I think that that's um that's not fair to them um and we'll will lose
businesses in the space so um I'm I'm not supportive of the amendment um and
will be supporting Council M's original motion counc
back thank you Mary little um thanks everyone for your comments so far thank you staff for all of the work that's
gone into getting us to this point just three times that we've looked at this recently but going back many many years
um and I think we all agree that we want to provide some relief to um residents in Deep Cove and try to make uh
everything work better down there and at those those peak times of the year um
but I do agree with the mayor's comments um I I'm not supportive of going beyond
what staff are presenting here in in this recommendation um I would like to
see us look at this uh um after this season so that um in a shorter period of
time we we can get a sense of whether or not this is um having the effect that we hope it would have and we can um
incrementally um add more areas for RPO Etc um but I I don't want to go any
further than this uh right now um I too am supportive of of assisting um you or
being aware of of the challenges of the businesses and the staff uh in that area so I I do support that part of the
motion um as well um just wanted to address a couple of other
things um in terms of the issue of the Ann the cost of the annual parking passes I think $35 a year is is quite
reasonable if you look at RPO in in other communities like the city of Vancouver for example where I think it's
quite a bit more than that um I would like to see shuttle service explored
again I know the report indicates that you know this is something that's been tried and it was unsuccessful um I still
think if it's properly done um people will look to um use a service like a
shuttle service to to get down to the Cove um but those are sort of my comments uh right now I I'm supportive
of the motion but not the amendment okay thank you very much at this moment I see no further speakers on
the amendment to call the question on the amendment all those in favor of the
amendment all those opposed motion is is
defeated um well it's because it's a tie well I I I have to count you in favor if
you didn't vote against it um there's no yes councelor Forbes I am I didn't see
your hand you were in favor okay so it ties to defeat three to three and so the amendment is defeated we're back onto
the original main motion uh do we have a were was there a speakers list underway for the original
motion okay thank you councelor muy on the main motion please and I believe you
have spoken once on the main motion so this is your additional two minute on the main
motion only on the amendment okay there you
go um well I'm really disappointed that we couldn't simply expand we have
hundreds and hundreds we have thousands of cars coming into the the area we have
hundreds of parking spots that are turning over every three to four hours
for people to go and support the businesses um we have lines of cars driving through
the Cove we are constantly saying please find alternatives to driving your car
please take the bus please walk please ride a bike except when you come to Deep
Cove don't worry we're going to have some parking spots for you because we do not want to return livability to an area
that has been under siege for years okay when when you go down into the Cove
on a weekend um and see people parking in people's driveways um where they are parking
illegally everywhere where they are driving around the block dozens of times
to try to find the coveted parking spot that is a couple of blocks away from the park that is not environmentally
sustainable living that is not respons responsible living for the res residents and the businesses in the community
because it is impacting them as well they can't be any busier um when you
have impacts to the surrounding Trail Network where new access points are
popping up on every street climbing that mountain that is not what our sustainable vision is for
our community um this has been a problem for uh years this has been a problem since
Instagram was invented and Air France did a commercial on quy Rock um the
congestion in the Cove is unlike uh so many areas in the region and the region
is actually trying to address it bunson Lake for instance has put a reservation system in and it actually solved the
problem um Port Moody and anmore no longer had to close a road because of the throngs of people coming into an
area um the West End as I brought up before in the past has resident only parking with pockets of public parking
for um people that are visiting but you do not drive into the West End thinking you're going to be able to park on a
street um Horseshoe Bay for decades has had resident only parking throughout the
entire area except in the core where they've got their parking lots which is comparative comparable to the parking
lots that we have with sea SE Cove and Cove Cliff Elementary and our own um uh
our own municipal our own Municipal Lots this is not just
about Resident only parking so residents can park on the street and visitors
can't this is about managing congestion of cars that don't stop coming into the
area on the long weekends to the point where um a few weeks ago on the Eastern long weekend there was um so much
congestion um and you know road rage is a regular occurrent down there um we had
a flagger hit by a car actually run over and drag through the parking lot in Panorama parking lot um today I heard
from somebody that was at the Costco in Langley that said there was so much um there was a a fight that broke out in
the parking lot and the police were called because people were fighting over parking spots like I I'm not sure what
we've we've become as a society um when we're dealing with this kind of chaos um
I had a resident in Deep Cove um argue with a visitor who said why can't I park
at the bottom of eastly Lane why can't I park in your driveway and they said well you can't
because we park in our driveway but this res this visitor actually wanted to come in and park in their driveway simply
because it was empty and he couldn't find a spot I don't know why it's so challenging for us to um I'll take my
other two minutes I don't understand why we can't find a better balance between
um our residents our taxpayers our businesses and our visitors it's like we
open the door and say everybody can come at the same time on Saturday at 2: in the afternoon and guess what they do
they all come at the same time we are not wanting to impact the businesses in
fact the the um the age-old story in the Cove is that um if there was a little
bit more breathing room all the locals would come back and support the businesses but right now the locals
don't go to The Cove because it's so chaotic we want to support those businesses too I fought for those
businesses I was one of those businesses in the Cove um so I I'm very
disappointed that there's not more support in tweaking um staff's plan um this is not
going this is going to do very little to reduce the circulation um issues that we
have in the Cove um I did hear some counselors um at the workshop say let's just deal with this let's get get going
um I'm glad counselor mom I'm totally supportive of of looking at um employee exemptions because I know it's
challenging um but I'm really disappointed that with adding a few roads like Lock Haven is and Lock Haven
cliffmont and uh Rayburn Rayburn is right next door to kof Cliff Elementary
it's right on the back gravel field of kof Cliff Elementary like why do we not
want to put uh some restricted parking in there when there's an entire lot for
people to pull into it's not unreasonable Parkside Lane is a little tiny skinny Lane with ditches on both
sides you know with a dead end that winds up in a driveway like I don't understand why
it's unreasonable to include those roads um yeah I'm really disappointed I'm I'm
I've been fighting this fight for you know 20 years and I guess I'm going to continue fighting it and um and the
residents are going to keep fighting it Council doesn't want to try to find just a little bit of a tweaked balance and I
certainly didn't come into this chamber tonight thinking that I was going to get RPO everywhere I'm fine trying to create
a balance but I'm disappointed that Council couldn't just add a few more roads with a mixture of seasonal RPO and
time limited exempt councelor M thank you very much okay um on the main motion
uh any additional comments councelor ma second time speaking Yeah
thank you I don't have the history that uh
Council Murray has in that area I have tried to listen to some members of the community to learn about
it I saw earlier on the staff drawings about three concentric circles about you
know the three different groups you had the residents you had the businesses and you had the
visitors I would argue and hopefully this you know I'll be more
uh VOC about this um at the appropriate time when it comes back on the review
but I think we need to give priority to the residents followed closely by
businesses the challenge is businesses are successful by both the residents and
visitors so I understand the challenge the staff have but if we had to put them in order my first order is the residence
this a comment um a second point and and I had a discussion with Peter but I I
think it might be uh Mr milburn's group more but I think enforcement is going to
be important and critical to whatever we Implement there and you know we talk
about budgets we talk about being responsible but we also talk about our community we may have to look at whether
we need uh you know I don't know the hours that are bylaw officers there I
don't want to get at that level in terms of making those kind of decisions but I think it's it's important that we look
at enforcement if we're going to have rules there and these rules are going to have this impact that we want then we
better make sure that those rules are enforced okay thank you thank you
councelor m councelor Pope thank you very much
um well I too am deeply concerned about residents in Deep Cove and the kind of
chaos that's been brought into their lives um and I I'm just not sure there's
a perfect solution um I I do appreciate that staff have you know tried to
navigate this and and come back with with a couple of different options um I
actually favor option two that endorses um uh pay parking on all the
streets I think that we've seen that that works in other jurisdictions and um it would certainly
send a strong message that people can't um park for free uh all day um and it
would enable more people to to come and better traffic flow uh I'd also like to see still like
to see uh a shuttle of some kind on the weekend or in peak hours during s during
the summer season I think it's it has been tried in the past but it wasn't as
bad as it is now um and so I think that's worth a second look um I do also
believe that we need enforcement to be really like really Hefty findes for
people parking in people's driveways or longer than they're supposed to on the
street or where they're not supposed to um and uh I think we need to probably
hire more people to ensure that that happens or summer students or some
something um and we need to do it this summer uh and not wait until next year
which raises another point I'd like to see reporting come back um uh this year
not wait until a whole other summer goes by and then have more I'd like to see some kind of fome report in the this
fall uh in addition to I knowe that there will be the tweaking done uh as we
go um this year so that's good and I also support parking looking at parking
exemptions for staff um I think that's something we have to be cognizant of
um those are my thoughts so I'm not quite sure where that leaves me with the options but I think but I think it it's
option two because option two includes the pay parking on the street I got that
right your Joyce additional comments yeah just some comments your worship um
one of our goals first of all we've made changes to the Cove every single year we make changes every single year whether
it's overflow parking or changes around thepo um trying to keep up with that and one of the purpos with the workshops was
to show you the toolkit we had but the engineers are running out a bit of the toolkit so it's it's down to a community
political decision on this front the only thing to keep in mind is we again because of the chaos I acknowledge that
is to get something done for this summer which I start for me is May long weekend and that's on us now and you heard Mr
cooh say a couple of weeks ago after the workshop we can we can do that um this is a four-fold increase into RPO so to
councelor Ma's point we are absolutely uh you know prioritizing the residence or the Cove on the parking and
the safety issues to council M's Point yeah there could be tweaking um this is our our best shot at it at this point in
time but if there's safety issues that come up with culde saacs or Lanes or whatever we can look that as well but
I'd encourage Council to go with this and get something done this summer um so that we can so we can continue to
improve in a battle that we continue to struggle with with residents coming to the C for visitors the shuttle bus uh
that last time we tried was on a uh a loop um with uh the suspension bridge
and um gr Mountain I think this time and staff are looking at it we'd look at a staging area just over the second narrow
specifically for the Cove I think is the only way that's going to work you'd have to have a staged area where hopefully we
can find a location maybe cap University or something along those lines and then have that buzzle direct into the Cove
and then back as opposed to doing the the three the three-point route which really there was no take up on so uh
what came out of the study we did seven or eight years ago with two big things was pay parking which is coming your way as you know in the Parks and the shuttle
bus so those are those are in play but I would encourage council tonight to to give direction to staff so we can get
something in place for the residents this summer thank you Y and there is a motion
on the floor that I think gives Direction on the bulk of of this issue so um councelor Pope you still had time
if you wanted to add further comments or you're complete thank you very much councelor
back your comments thank you very much uh I just wanted to reiterate my support for the motion on the floor because I do
want to see some action taken for this summer season um and as Mr Joyce has
pointed out this does represent a large increase in in RPO um with the ability
to to tweak it and I look forward to seeing the results of of how um this initial plan works uh when we when we
take a look at it after this summer season um I would love to again take
another look at the shuttle service and how we can make that more effective and see more uptake on it
um I would also um sorry wanted to talk about Cory Rock
obviously uh when you talk about Instagram Cory rock is where people want to go in the summer um and I don't know
if that we've ever looked at any kind of a pass reservation system for that uh much like has been done um the Seymour
Mount Seymour Provincial Park for instance um but I think maybe that's something that we want may want to explore as well when that's that's where
so much of the uh of the summer traffic wants to go and and do that hike that everybody's seen uh on social media um
and then you know I I'll feel more comfortable um making parking more restrictive when we have Transportation
Investments that are actually complete and right now there is still no safe way to uh ride to Deep Cove um that's uh ex
you know for all ages and abilities um I know you know we have we are making sign significant investments in Spirit Trail
but it's going to be a few years 2027 uh being the target for having that link to deep Gove so um you know that's when
I'll feel comfortable saying that you know we're providing alternatives for people but to driving um but right now
um those alternatives are not are not fully there so I think as a starting point um you know this is a plan that's
taken into account a lot of different needs and I'm comfortable with it as I say with the ability to tweak it as we
go along um my comments on the on the
motion um I don't know how comfortable I am with issuing staff parking passes uh I
know that I would definitely benefit from it meaning I've got two kids that work in the c um but I still think that
it probably violates to some degree our um our legal restriction on providing
direct assistance to businesses um and because you would you would be making it so that they would have an advantage and
free parking for their workers which is seems like a direct benefit to them
which I think would violate the provincial regulations that we have on it so um I would be curious if staff are
going to look into the matter if they could um perhaps give us some direction on on that legality piece um uh I I do
think that the businesses are under a tremendous amount of pressure and they have a hard time hiring uh because uh
the um the 211 and the 212 go to such limited runs um after certain hours
although most of the businesses are operating within their service hours U but um we do need to badly increase the
uh the weekend access on both the 211 and the 212 directly into the cope um they're not adequate service on the
weekends uh for the numbers of people that are going into there um but for the businesses itself I I I'll be curious
what staff come up with in their presentation um and look at you know what they would contemplate for that but
um it's not something we offer anywhere else even in other very congested business spaces in other congested
business spaces like klano suspension bridge the gr Mountain we expect them to
provide opportunities for their staff either providing them Transit passes or
uh pay parking or uh it becomes a taxable benefit if they actually offer them parking within their space um and
so I think that um you know I I on the on the face of it I don't I don't know
that that's uh lawful for us to do it but I I will look forward to staff reporting on it
um on the general parking restrictions I I do think this is an incremental process we will try it out we've tried
out different things in the past we've made progress some things have worked some things haven't worked um and we'll
just keep moving towards that this is not an insignificant change quadrupling the amount of RPO is a very substantive
change within the community um and definitely goes to the benefit of the residents so anything it says it's it's
not um significant it is extremely significant um I get that there are still some uh streets uh and I will talk
to staff directly about the issues on Parkside Lane I don't think it should have I I it may not be appropriate for
any parking necessarily as well um uh not simply who owns the car uh it's an
extremely challenging Street to get in and out of without having to go onto people's private property to be able to
to do it um and so uh we should be looking at that separately uh but as far
as I'm concerned this is a step in the right direction it balances off the different priorities that we gave staff
and directed them to report back on so I'll be supportive of the motion as U
presented Council Forbes additional comments um yes um do I understand
correctly that what if we Implement what staff is presenting tonight is it coming
are we going to review it again in the fall uh it will be a combination of
things it would be implementing the changes at the earliest opportunity it
can be but then also reporting back on how the implementation measures are working can I get a clarification from
staff MR2 Mr Joyce e worship you know as part of the plan every week through the
summer we actually report out through the Rangers about how the Cove was behaving and so you'll get an update
instantly with with what's happening in the numbers and the volumes as as this goes through but we'll have a much
better picture as things settle in and I recognize it may take a full season before folks recognize it may be not
worth their while to drive all the way into the cold because of the limited area of public parking it's not going to
happen instantly uh but it should over a period of time help with that um and
again I'm going to go back to csor Ma's points this is really staff's attempt to to certain balance a little bit would
give much more preference to the locals and the livability of the neighborhood but at the same providing some parking
from some visitors and for the businesses think you've heard from a number of members of council that they'd like the report back uh in the fall if
possible um uh waiting till the spring to make changes doesn't give the the community enough leadup time to prepare
for changes so uh yeah I'm sure staff can provide some updated the fal some analytics for the summer months yeah I'd
like to see a fall report myself and then we can because it's also sta it's not just Community getting use it's also
if tweaks further tweaks need to be made it gives staff time to make further tweaks maybe the tweaks that were
mentioned tonight maybe not um so I'd like to see that report back in the fall
um I will say I agree with you mayor about the benefit of staff parking it
almost contradicts itself that the businesses are trying to survive but if parking spaces are taken up by
staff who is working not buying I'm not sure that that's an appropriate use of
parking spaces um maybe the shuttle has come up again maybe the businesses need
to um arrange a sh a shuttle that the businesses pay for that comes from the
parking lots to bring their staff the staff has to get to that parking lot by a certain time if they want to ride in
so I mean something like that where they're not actually taking up the spaces in the C because I think it it's
self-defeating to give away staff passes um so that's my comment on that I am I
am a bit disappointed about that we couldn't do more tweaking tonight um but
I do appreciate all the work staff did and I do appreciate that it's a big going to be a big change it will be a
big change it's not small um so I'll look forward to the fall and see what
the results are very much I see no further speakers on the matter prepared to call the question all in
favor contrary minded motion carries unanimously okay
thank you very much uh Council um uh we're a little tight on our 10:30 uh if
it's okay with you I think we'll leave reports to another day um uh and so uh
Adjournment
having completed the business of the evening I'll accept adjournment thank you very much councelor mury uh we are
adjourned I did just want to say thank you very much to the staff for preparing the reports for our consideration thank you members of the public for
participating in our meeting everybody have a fantastic evening and week good night
